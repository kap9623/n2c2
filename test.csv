POLK GENERAL HOSPITAL

Internal Medicine

86 Lisbon Lane                             Golden, Matias

Palacios, NE  73819                             97198841

                                              12-25-90 







The patient is a 36-year-old man who comes in with a problem list that 

includes diabetes, high cholesterol, microalbuminuria, and probable lichen simplex 

chronicus.



Since I last saw him, he has changed insurances and needs new refills on 

all his medications. He has been without it for a couple of days. He has 

had no polyuria or polydipsia, and generally feels well. He has no chest 

pain, shortness of breath - no abdominal discomfort. He has no problems 

with is feet or eyesight. He has not seen an eye doctor in the past 

year.



MEDICATIONS:

Lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, Glyburide. He is not currently using 

the metronidazole pill any longer. 



Laboratory Data: Last cholesterol was an LDL of 101 in September, Hgb 

A1C of 6.1.



PHYSICAL EXAM:

Patient is well appearing. His blood pressure is 140/82 in the right arm 

sitting, but this is also off his lisinopril. His weight is 168 lbs. 

Examination of the feet reveals response to vibratory sensation and 

light touch. There are no lesions. There is an approximately 2cm 

nonscaling plaque over the dorsal lateral aspect of the right ankle, 

which is pruritic.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1. Diabetes mellitus. Wait until he is back on his medications before 

checking his laboratory tests, including the microalbumin. He will come 

back in a few months to have these done.

2. Hyperlipidemia. I will check his lipids on his return visit.

3. Lichen simplex chronicus. Topical lidex was prescribed b.i.d. to the 

effected area only.



I will see him in several months in follow up visit on his laboratory 

work.

74 yo female with a past medical history of poorly controlled diabetes (Hem A1C 10.3 in 2/85), hypertension and  hyperlipidemia who presents with two days of left eye pain and a one day history of nausea and vomiting.  The patient's eye pain began on 2 days prior to admission and has progressed to a severe stabbing pain that precipitated a visit to the MARY ED. The patient notes that her vision is more cloudy that usual although she does not see well out of that eye at baseline.  No right eye symptoms.   The patient also developed nausea and abdominal tenderness this AM.  The pain was mild.  She describes the pain as centered in her epigastrium.  She does not report chest pain or pressure and reports no symptoms of radiation to her shoulder or jaw.  She notes that the nausea is not associated with exercise or relieved by rest.  The discomfort has been constant since it began this am.  She denies hematemasis, fevers, chills, diarrhea.  The patient denies ever having chest pain or shortness of breath with exertion. 



IN the ED the patient was found to have a markedly elevated Intraocular pressure of 54.

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 



CXR: 

	No CHF.  On the lateral view only there is some increased patchy

	opacity in the posterior clear space which could represent

	developing atelectasis or, in the proper clinical setting, could

	represent a subtle focus focus of pneumonia.  There is new

	blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles consistent with a

	small amount of pleural fluid.



Abdominal Ultrasound:

NEGATIVE STUDY.



Exercise Stress Test:

  No ST segment changes were observed during this test.

        Arrhythmias:

          None.

        Comments:

        Fair exercise capacity. At peak exercise, patient complained of

        indigestion feeling relieved by belching after several minutes.

        Negative for ischemia.



EKG: 

NSR.  New TWI in V2, q in III, normal axis and intervals, no ST changes

	          	          

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:



The patient is a 74 yo female with poorly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute closed angle glaucoma and nausea and vomiting. 



1.	Glaucoma.



Likely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  As recommended by the ophthalmologic consultant, I will give the following meds

	-Xalatan qHS

-Pred Forte QID

-Timolol BID

-Trusopt BID

-Acetazolamide BID

-Alphagan

IOP will be monitored closely.  If it does not trend down, the patient may need surgery in the AM.



2.	Nausea and Vomiting



The differential diagnosis is broad and includes symptoms related to glaucoma, atypical angina, symptoms from an SBO given her history, chemical pancreatitis and viral gastroenteritis.  Of these, I believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely.  

-	I ordered a KUB on the floor which showed normal bowel gas per unofficial rads read.  

-	I think angina is unlikely given her history.  However, I believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes.  I will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow (weekend day), but I believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future.  I will give ASA, B blocker and ACE.  I will not give heparin given that her TIMI score is only 1. 

-	Chemical pancreatitis is possible although her exam is so bengin. I will therefore give pt full liqs tonight and follow her for pancreatitis symptoms.



3.	Chronic Renal Failure



This is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy. Pt is at baseline creatinine



4.	Anemia



Pt is at baseline creatinine.  She was found to have sickle cell trait.  Iron studies, B12, folate WNL. Hct stable



5.	Diabetes



Will continue NPH and Regular insulin and cover with SSI.



6.	Prophylaxis



On nexium.  Holding heparin prophylaxis because the patient is ambulatory.

Patient Name: WILHELM, GOLDY;  MRN: 9543443

Dictated at: 05/06/2092 by EDWARD XAYASANE, M.D. 



 

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right leg pain and difficulty walking.   

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Wilhelm is a 68-year-old right-handed female who has had a three-week history of having right leg pain and difficulty walking. She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot. She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee. She states that it went away at that time. The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician.  An MRI was ordered. Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better. She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain. She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner. Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.  

 

Therapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy. She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis. Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge. Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay. She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.  

 

MEDICATIONS: Currently, the medication she is on is Celebrex, Hyzaar for her blood pressure, and Darvocet for her pain.   

ALLERGIES: She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation, and ibuprofen causes tinnitus.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has got high blood pressure and shoulder arthritis.  

 

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a left breast biopsy which she states was not cancerous.  

 

SOCIAL/FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: She is functionally currently not working. She is taking sick time. She has not worked for the past three weeks. She is a Head Nurse and worked at The Library Corporation for the last 35 years. She states her job is medium as far as intensity of work. Functionally, her activities of daily living are limited, and she uses an assistive device.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and she has four healthy children, ages 51, 50, 48, and 46. She does not smoke or drink.   

FAMILY HISTORY: She has aunts with diabetes and brother that had an myocardial infarction at 59.  

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, no fevers, chills, recent infections, bladder, thyroid problems, rash, shortness of breath, palpations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bowel or bladder or sexual problems or urination difficulty.  She does have some joint pain and swelling in her shoulders and her feet occasionally. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She does have some trouble walking secondary to the pain. She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed. She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time. On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits. Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees. Side-bending was unremarkable. On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left. Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right.  Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left. On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left. Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles. Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left. Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.  

 

IMPRESSION:  

1. Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.  

2. Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.  

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.  

2. Physical therapy after her injection.  

3. Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex.  4. Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.   

The patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.

Record date: 2097-06-03

 Time of visit: 6/03/2097, 1330 hours
Time of note: 1630 hours

Patient seen and examined with the team.  Note of Dr. Ellis reviewed, findings confirmed.  Available electronic notes reviewed, X-rays reviewed, labs reviewed.  

73 y. o. woman who has worked as a nurse at TLC for 40 years.  Nonsmoker.  History of hypertension treated with Hyzaar.  Current illness began 5-6 months ago with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4-5 steps in a stairwell.  She finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue.  She has had a cough that initially produced yellowish, ""slimy"" sputum, but more recently has been dry.  She notes occasional wheezing.  She also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past 5-6 months that she attributed to ""arthritis"".  No polyuria, but has noted nocturia X2 for the past 5-6 months. During the same period of time, has noted very dry mouth. No abdominal pain, but some difficulty with constipation for the past two weeks.

Appetite diminished and she lost about 30 pounds.  She noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her PCP ""cut into"" recently.  She has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to ""get larger"".  

She experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours, prompting her to come to the ER.  No associated diaphoresis, nausea.  Pain somewhat better with sitting up.  

Of note, she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years.  

Exam:  Pleasant black woman in no distress.  BP 158/79, Pulse 80, regular; O2 sat 98% on room air.  Afebrile.  Skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface, similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4th/5th toe.  No other rashes.  HEENT:  pale conjunctivae, anicteric.  No nasal findings, no facial skin findings (specifically, no lupus pernio).  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck: small, soft, mobile 0.5 cm node left anterior cervical chain.  Chest:  inspiratory crackles at both bases.  Cardiac: No JVD.  Regular rhythm.  III/VI (I do not feel a thrill) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium, but especially prominent at the RUSB with radiation to the clavicles, neck.  Also heard at the apex and radiates to the left mid-back (?same murmur).  The murmur intensifies when she stands.  No gallops.  No rub.  Abdomen soft and nontender.  No spleen tip.  Liver edge not palpable.  
Lymph nodes:  fullness below the left axilla, although not confident of discrete nodes.  

Data:  There is considerable testing available to us from her recent visits to the Walk-In Clinic and to Dr. Utter.  

A CXR from 5/2097 shows bilateral hilar adenopathy, mediastinal adenopathy, and interstitial infiltrates.

Serum angiotensin converting enzyme 68 (7-46 U/L)
LDH 354

EKG:  ST elevations V1-3.

Problems:

1.  Dyspnea on exertion, progressive.
2.  Interstitial lung disease.
3.  Bilateral hilar adenopathy
4.  Weight loss
5.  Symptomatic hypercalcemia
		Nocturia
		Arthralgias
		Constipation
		Fatigue
6.  Prominent systolic murmur(s?). Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data.
7.  Minimally elevated troponins.  Uncertain significance.
8.  Anemia, mildly microcytic.
9.  Elevated LDH.
10.  Renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia.
11.  History of hypertension.

Discussion:

Sarcoidosis, until proven otherwise.  She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.  The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.  

Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.  She should not receive diuretics at present.  Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.  I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.  

The cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.  We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.  The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.  Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.  

Suggest:

1.  Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted.
2.  IV normal saline.  May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach.
3.  Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels.
4.  Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct.
5.  Agree with check echocardiogram.
6.  We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.  Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

Internal Medicine B Intern Admission Note

PATIENT: GOLDY WILHELM
MRN: 9543443
ADMIT DATE: June 29, 2097
ATTENDING: Dr. William Xian
PCP: Dr. Casey Frey (new)

ID/CC: no appetite, acute renal failure

HPI: 73 yo black woman with h/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue, weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on 6/2-6/20/97. At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss. 

In early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes. The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma. Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV. The patient   s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.

Axillary lymph node biopsy 6/08/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process. Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population. Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities.  The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced. On 7/19/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed. Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia. Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization. 
 
Since discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not    felt like eating.    She reports significant acid reflux, saying    only water goes down    and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth. She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure/day per her family. She further denies N/V, diarrhea, fever/chills/dizziness or recent infection. Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes. She has not had a bowel movement for several days. She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.

In addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization. She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household. She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping, relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally. She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game. She denies suicidal ideation, saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for.
   
ED COURSE: At the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR 59, BP 136/61, RR 16, O2 Sat 95%. She was given IVF and labs were drawn.

ECG: NSR @ 82bpm, LVH unchanged from prior study


Impression: 
73F h/o newly dx HOCM, chronic systemic LAD, fatigue, and weight loss concerning for sarcoid vs. PBC vs. neoplasm, presenting with acute renal failure in setting of little PO intake and likely hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia (as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis, with dehydration, anorexia, constipation, and PUD, fatigue and depression. This would thus represent a unifying diagnosis for this pt   s anorexia and acute renal failure, which is most likely prerenal.

Plan: 
ARF: - f/u Ca + Phos. Expect Ca to be high, Phos to be low. Cont IVF
   - Cre 2.2   1.8 (bl 1.2-15) s/p IVF 500cc x1, on D5    NS @ 100cc/hr, re-evaluate and re-bolus in AM
          - Maintain good UO, no Foley b/c recording stricts I   s + O   s, 700cc out of clear urine O/N
Fatigue/Weight Loss/LAD/lack of appetite: 
-prior labs somewhat concerning for PBC, esp with elev AlkP
-f/u anti-mitochondrial Ab, TSH, f/u pending labs from prior w/u
-consider re-attempting transbronchial biopsy, revisit w/ thoracics 
Anemia: -Hct stable, slightly microcytic. MVI

HPI: Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, HTN, DM, and sarcoidosis who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 after which she was discharged to Harton Center on 11/07 and then re-admitted to MEDIQUIK on 11/17 with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a saddle pulmonary embolus as well as large right lower extremity DVT.  She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake.  This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.  She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.  The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.  The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.  She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.  She denies fevers, chills, headaches, cough, abdominal pain, or change in the character of her colostomy output.  


ED COURSE:  
On arrival to the ED, vitals were as follows: 98, 164/84, 84, 24, 98%/RA.  Her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended.  CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified.  She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed.  She was given 2L of IVF and morphine 2mg IV x2.   


ROS
As above, otherwise reports baseline blurry vision (has been told of cataracts in the past). Denies SOB, cough, CP, chest pressure, orthopnea, palpitations.
Foley catheter in place but denies suprapubic tenderness.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:
CXR (12/14):     Lines/tubes:  Interval placement of left-sided PICC line the tip of the PICC line does not cross midline there is a nasogastric tube with the tip below the diaphragm
     Lungs:  There is a persistent opacity in the left mid hemithorax
     Pleura:  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
     Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are normal.


CT Abd (12/14):     LOWER THORAX: There been interval resolution of the previously identified bilateral pleural effusions.  There is linear atelectasis of the lung bases.
     HEPATOBILIARY: No focal hepatic lesions.  No biliary ductal dilatation.  There are stable findings of porcelain gallbladder.
     SPLEEN: No splenomegaly.
     PANCREAS: No focal masses or ductal dilatation.
     ADRENALS: No adrenal nodules.
     KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis, stones, or solid mass lesions. Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified, stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts.
     PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: There is a Foley catheter in place. There is a fibroid uterus.
     
     PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air is seen.  There is trace free fluid.
     LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.
     VESSELS: There are scattered vascular calcifications. An IVC filter is in place.
     GI TRACT: There is diffuse dilation of the proximal and mid small bowel with multiple air fluid levels.  There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated.  There has been a prior  a prior colostomy. There is diverticulosis.
     BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified.  Alternately, this could reflect ileus.  Close clinical follow up advised.   




EKG: NSR at 94bpm, leftward axis, biatrial enlargement, normal PR interval, narrow QRS, LVH, TWIs in I, aVL


ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, hypertension, sarcoidosis, diabetes, who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 and was re-admitted on 11/17 with a saddle PE and large RLE DVT for which she was managed with IVC filter and anticoagulation who now presents with several days of nausea and vomiting and concern for small bowel obstruction on CT.  



SBO: Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction (although ileus remains a possibility.  Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.  Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.  

Appreciate surgery input
NGT to low wall suction
NPO except meds for bowel rest
Serial abdominal exams
Check colostomy output guaiac
Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.  With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.  

Continue IVF while NPO
Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs
Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30.  She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.  She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.  Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.  

Transfuse 1U PRBCs
Check colostomy guaiac
Check iron studies, reticulocyte count
Elevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.  She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.  She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding.

Hold Coumadin for now
Follow up INR, goal 2-3
HOCM/HTN: 

Continue lopressor, verapamil
Sarcoid:

Continue Prednisone at 5mg daily
PAF

Continue Amiodarone &#8211; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio


F/E/N:  NPO
PPX: coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen

PCP:  Dr. Casey Frey



HPI: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli. She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX. Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection. Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility. Patient has no complaints. Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills. However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED.

Imaging: 

CXR (8/2/98): 1.  Increased interstitial markings may represent worsened mild pulmonary edema or interstitial infection.



Abd CT (7/18/98): Near complete resolution of previously seen left lower quadrant fluid collection. Stable small cystic lesions in pancreas which likely represent side branch IPMN.



Abd CT (6/30/98): New 4.8 x 4.0 cm thick walled fluid collection in the LLQ which contains a small amount of gas.  This would be amenable to percutaneous drainage. Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size. Bilateral benign renal cysts. Gallbladder wall calcifications.



A/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. 



1. Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear. It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection. At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI. Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression. 

                - F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures

                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would 

                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)

- Culture if spikes

                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically 

                 improve



2. Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past. During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy. GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy. It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive. 

                - Type and screen

                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement

                - Check post-transfusion Hct 



3. HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents

                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB

                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)

4. Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR. Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding. As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her. 

                - Monitor daily INRs

                - Hold warfarin overnight



5. Renal insufficiency &#8211; Cr 1.58 today (baseline 1.2). Likely secondary to prerenal 

                - Fluid resuscitation 

                - Recheck lytes in AM



6. Diabetes

Personal Data and Overall Health

Mrs. Barr is a 57  years old lady with multiple significant medical problems new to KEKELA.



Chief Complaint

She is here today for a Physical  Exam



History of Present Illness

Patient has HO HTN for years and CVA. She has had 4 CVAs in the past. First one in 2087, 2088, 2089 and 2090. She was not taking her BP meds those times and she has been smoking 1 PPD since then despite being told she had to quit smoking.

She was seen at the LDC ED twice in Jan 13 and 21/05. First visit she was taken by her son after he couldn't take care of her anymore. Not doing anything at home, not caring about anything. Was seen by psych and arranged to have a PCP, spoke about therapy as well. 

Then 1/21/93 seen for chest pain. EKG negative and was D/C home. Had a MIBI done 1/23/93

    

     1.  Clinical Response:  Non-ischemic.

     2.  ECG Response:  No ECG changes during infusion.

     3.  Myocardial Perfusion:  Normal.

     4.  Global LV Function:  Normal.





She states she is supposed to be on Coumadin for the strokes and she self D/C it last year. Previous PCP at EDUCARE-FARGO Dr. Nancy Odell. Changing to KEKELA because her son thinks she can get better help here. 



She looks depressed and I mentioned that to her. She states ""I always have looked the same"". After speaking for her for 20 minutes she tells me that at age 28 she had a miscarriage of her twins. She was jumping rope and after coming back home her husband told her if she was trying to kill the twins. That night she had a miscarriage and one baby was born in the toilet and the otherone was taken by the EMTs. She was 4 months pregnant. She had therapy then and meds and felt a little better. Her husband died 6 years ago and before he died he reminded her that she had killed his twins. She felt bad and has felt bad since. She cries during interview.

She worked for many years for mcilhenny company, Fire Chief and retird last year. 

She denies being depressed, denies suicidal ideation or plan. States has trouble sleeping and wants AMbien she has taken in the past. Also has taken Zoloft in the past. Not interested on meds now.

KIM,DOUGLAS JR   201-63-51-2                VISIT DATE: 04/03/95

The patient was seen primarily by me. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Fall, right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Mr. Killian is a very pleasant 

54-year-old gentleman, with a history of diabetes, who had a fall 

on December 18, 2094.  At the time, he sustained an injury to his 

right knee which healed and then began to break down, and he 

developed a large wound which began draining and had foul odor.  

The patient had continued difficulty ambulating and presented to 

the emergency department for evaluation.  The patient denies having 

any hardware in his knee.  No history of osteomyelitis.  No 

hardware.  No history of peripheral neuropathy.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies any fevers or chills.  No nausea 

or vomiting.  No abdominal pain.  No chest pain or shortness of 

breath.  Patient is only complaining of difficulty ambulating 

secondary to the pain.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Two patellar tendon repairs at EDUCARE-PULLMAN in 2083, 

repair of a patellar fracture.  Recent diagnosis of diabetes, 

atrial fibrillation.  Hypertension, high cholesterol, and positive 

PPD.  

MEDICATIONS:  Please see nurses note for list of medications. 

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (rash). 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker.  He 

does not drink alcohol.  He works in engineering, and lives alone. 

Family history is noncontributory. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Patient is awake, alert, talking 

in full sentences, in mild distress secondary to pain.  VITAL 

SIGNS:  Afebrile, temperature 99.3, respiratory rate 20, blood 

pressure 161/96, pulse 95.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Supple.  

LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  

HEART:  Regular rate.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  ABDOMEN:  

Soft, nontender.  SKIN:  A large ulcer to the right knee, right 

over the patella, with significant amount of break-down necrotic 

tissue and purulent discharge with a foul odor.  The depth of the 

wound is difficult to assess.  Intact motor function and sensation. 

Full flexion and extension of the knee, and evidence of well-healed 

midline scar above the ulcer.  NEURO:  Intact with good pulses 

palpable throughout.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Plain film of the right knee, CT of the 

right knee, and laboratory values done.  Laboratory values 

demonstrated a white count of 14, ESR of 13, ESRP of 2.1.  Rest of 

the labs were normal except for an elevated glucose to 226.  Film 

of the knee shows patellofemoral arthritis with no evidence of 

osteomyelitis, no hardware seen.  CT of the knee showed a 

superficial ulcer to the depth of the patellar tendon but the 

patellar tendon itself was intact.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was initially seen by 

orthopedic who felt that the ulcer was over the patellar tendon, at 

the site of prior surgeries, with no effusion or joint pain, and 

normal range of motion with joint involvement unlikely.  We are all 

very hesitant to tap this knee and it will not be done at this time 

for fear of introducing infection into the joint.  The patient is 

awaiting consultation by general surgery for probable admission and 

debridement in the operating room.  The plan at this time was to 

hold off on antibiotics.  Blood cultures were sent.  The patient is 

receiving IV fluids. 

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedics, general surgery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Knee ulcer.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted and transitioned to ED Obs, awaiting evaluation by the 

surgical service for probable admission.  The patient is currently 

in stable and satisfactory condition, in Obs awaiting surgery 

evaluation.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fast heart rate.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of a left MCA stroke, atrial fibrillation,

hypertension, diabetes, and renal insufficiency who was

transferred from Southwest Montana Radiology for atrial

fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The patient has

been in Southwest Montana for the last several weeks.  During her

rehabilitation stay, the patient was noted to have sinus

bradycardia and sinus pauses.  The patient's metoprolol was

stopped.  The patient was previously on metoprolol 6.25 mg every

6 hours.  The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation with

rapid ventricular response on exam this morning.  The patient is

followed by Dr. Octavia Xue of Heritage Hospital Cardiology. 

Given the difficulty that Southwest Montana has had ____

the patient's atrial fibrillation, the patient was transferred

here to Riverton General Hospital for further management and

further placement.  The patient is asymptomatic.  The patient

denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient denies

any lightheadedness.  The patient has no other complaints.

following:  Temperature is 96.4, heart rate of 79, respiratory

rate of 18, blood pressure is 112/63, and oxygen saturations at

100% on room air.  The patient's oxygen saturation was

interpreted as normal.  General:  No acute distress, pleasant,

and multiple family members at bedside.  HEENT:  The patient's

head was normocephalic.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Posterior

oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  Supple.  No carotid bruits.  No

JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No focal

rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly

irregular, tachycardic.  No gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops were

appreciated.  GI:  Abdomen:  Soft.  No rebound or guarding. 

Minimal suprapubic tenderness to palpation.  G-tube in place. 

Rectal exam:  Deferred.  GU exam:  Deferred.  Skin:  Warm and

dry.  No rash or lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral

angle tenderness.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.  Lower

extremity pitting edema rising up to the knees.  No palpable

cords.  Neurologic:  The patient was alert and oriented.  The

patient moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.  The patient

did have a right facial droop.  I did not ambulate the patient.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of atrial fibrillation, and recent left MCA stroke

who was transferred from Southwest Montana for management

of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The

patient is hemodynamically stable at this time.  The patient is

asymptomatic.  The patient will need rate control and will need

to be admitted to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient then had 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's

12-lead EKG was notable for atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response.  The patient did have some nonspecific ST-T

changes when compared to her prior EKG.  The patient's laboratory

studies so far has been largely unremarkable.  The patient's

first set of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's

complete blood count was notable for an elevated white blood cell

count of 10.8.  The patient's hematocrit of 33.2.  The patient's

platelets were somewhat elevated at 560,000.  The patient's

portable chest x-ray has been ordered and results of the

patient's portable chest x-ray are still pending at this time. 

The case was then discussed with the Heritage Hospital

cardiologist on call.  The patient ____ will be admitted to

Heritage Hospital Cardiology and to a monitor bed.  I did try to

page Dr. Octavia Xue to let her know about the patient's

admission to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.  The patient and

patient's family were in agreement with the plan.  The patient

was started on metoprolol down her G-tube.  The patient had a

good response to the metoprolol.  The patient was given

metoprolol 6.25 mg.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

2.  History of a left MCA stroke.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Heritage Hospital

Cardiology.

Imaging:
Head CT: (my read) No hemorrhage, mass effect, or hypodensity/loss of grey-white junction.  No acute intracranial process.

Head MRI/MRA: pending


Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.  Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.  Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.  She has no face or leg weakness.

Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.  However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.

Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.

Recommendations:
-Head and neck MRI/MRA
-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
-Continue statin.
-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 


We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano. 


Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.  This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.  Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.  Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.  


Mrs. Doss continues to do well.  She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.  She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.  Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.  She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.  Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.  


Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).  Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.  However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.  She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.  She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.  She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.  


She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.  She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.  She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure.

Assessment and Recommendations:


58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.   She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.  We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.  The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.  If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.  However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.  Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.  


Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.  Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.  I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.  She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.  If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.  


Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.  Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.  
Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.   




Sincerely,

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Xiang. 

Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined

by me.  Please see the resident's note for details of the

patient's past medical, social, family history, review of

systems, and physical exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tingling and numbness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman with a

history of stroke and seizure in 12/2089 and a longstanding

history of diabetes who presents today with a sharp thumbtack

poking sensation in her right hand at 9:30 a.m. while driving. 

It lasted 3-4 seconds and then completely resolved.  Thirty

minutes later, she noticed a similar sensation in her right hand

for a few seconds and then resolved completely, and then she

noticed it in her right foot and the toes.  She wiggles her toes

in her shoe and then that resolved after a few seconds and then

30 minutes after that she had a similar but less severe sensation

in the fingertips of her left hand at about 10:45 that then

resolved completely.  Since then, she has had no sensation like

this.  She has had pins and needles feeling in her hands and feet

in the past, but never a sharp thumbtack feeling like this in the

past.  She had no dysarthria, confusion, weakness, numbness

trauma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope, seizure

activity, changes in her medications, or any new medications. 

She took her Plavix as usual this morning, is now symptom free,

and very well appearing.  She called her doctor's office and the

nurse told her to come to the Emergency Department to be checked.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,

seizures in the setting of a stroke in 12/2089, and a left MCA

stroke in 12/2089.  She has had no seizures since then.  She has

residual right lower extremity weakness, which is now much

improved.  Echo in 12/2089 showed an EF of 60%.  She has

concentric LVH, no wall motion abnormalities, and no other

surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past smoker of 30 pack years, ETOH none, and no

IV drug use.  She works as a Business Services Manager and lives

with her family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She takes Dilantin, glipizide, Glucophage, Plavix,

atenolol, Cozaar, and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with normal and stable

vital signs.  Awake, alert, and in no distress.  Her exam is

completely unremarkable including 5/5 strength in her upper and

lower extremities.  Gait is normal.  She has no cerebellar signs,

past pointing dysmetria, aphasia, ataxia, focal weakness, or any

focal sensory deficit at all.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG shows bradycardia at 50 beats a minute with

nonspecific T-wave changes.  Fingerstick is 150.  Dilantin level

is normal.  Head CT shows no evidence of bleeding or any other

abnormality.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Neurology was consulted and agrees

with the diagnosis of likely peripheral neuropathy.  They will

help arrange followup within 1 week for this patient with her

neurologist and she is told to see her primary care physician

within 2 weeks and to return to the Emergency Department for any

chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other worsening of her

symptoms.

DISPOSITION:  She is well appearing at the time of discharge in

satisfactory condition.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 




We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro. 





Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.  She was last seen here in December 2091. 
Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.  Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.  However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.  



Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.  She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.  She denies any recent seizures.  After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

Assessment and Recommendations:



60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.  Her clinical examination remains intact.  She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.  Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.  Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.  Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.  If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).  After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.  She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.  



We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.  The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.  (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)  Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.  Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.  



Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.  As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.     





Sincerely,

The patient returns for a follow up visit on her diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.  She is regularly being followed by Dr. Jarvis, Nephrologist at Salvation Army Hospital, was seen there about two months ago and will return there in June.  She is also treated for her chronic anemia with darbopoetin.  The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia.  Blood sugars are often 60 or less.  The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.



Physical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 142/60, weight is 176 pounds, and pulse is 96.  Glucose done in the exam room today was 110.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, negative S3, S4, and no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities: No edema and nontender.  Right hand tenderness in the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the overlying tendon and also tenderness diffusely in the right shoulder pain with grossly normal range of motion.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars have been dropping.  The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily.  I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily.  Check hemoglobin A1c today as well as ALT, AST, and creatinine.

2.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure.  She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.

3.  Tendonitis, right middle finger.  After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

4.  Anemia.  This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease.  She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks.  We will check CBC today.

5.  Right shoulder pain.  The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.

6.  Regular healthcare maintenance.  The patient will follow up with me in about two months.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 58-year-old 
non-English-speaking Hispanic woman who presents for evaluation of 
waxing and waning epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain 
for the past five days.  The patient was in her usual state of 
health until one week ago, when she developed an upper respiratory 
tract infection.  She was seen by her primary care physician, who 
treated her with Biaxin.  The patient took the Biaxin; however, she 
developed some epigastric abdominal pain on Tuesday.  She called 
her primary care physician, who attributed her abdominal pain to a 
Biaxin reaction.  She was told to discontinue the Biaxin on Thursday. 
The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
or constipation.  She denies any dysuria, polyuria, or hematuria. 
She denies any vaginal discharge.  She denies any shortness of 
breath or chest pain.  She denies any arm, jaw, or back pain.  She 
denies any diaphoresis or dizziness.  She does admit to some 
burping and indigestion. 
She describes the pain as cramping in nature.  It waxes and wanes. 
It does not radiate anywhere.  Nothing seems to improve or worsen 
the pain. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, and otherwise negative.  In 
particular, on cardiovascular review, she denies chest pain, arm 
pain, jaw pain, or back pain; she denies any diaphoresis, 
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea on exertion, or palpitations. 
On pulmonary, she admits to cough, but denies hemoptysis.  The 
abdominal review is as per the HPI; she denies melena.  The GU 
review is as per HPI. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (1) Type I diabetes mellitus; (2) 
Hypertension; (3) Hypothyroidism; (4) Asthma; (5) Current upper 
respiratory tract infection. 
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler; glucophage; insulin; codeine. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative tobacco.  The family 
history is negative for diabetes mellitus. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the vital signs 
reveal a temperature of 98.6 degrees F., a blood pressure of 
146/74, a pulse of 88, and a respiratory rate of 20.  The O2 
saturation is 96% on room air.  In general, the patient is in no 
acute distress.  The HEENT examination reveals the head to be 
normocephalic; the examination is atraumatic.  EOMI.  PERLA.  The 
throat is clear.  The neck is supple, with no JVD or bruits.  The 
chest shows no crepitus or retractions.  The lungs have coarse 
breath sounds.  The heart has a regular rhythm and rate without 
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, with some very 
mild epigastric tenderness, but no guarding, rebound, referred 
pain, flank tenderness, palpable masses, or pulsatile masses.  The 
extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis, clubbing, 
or edema.  On neurologic, there are no focal findings. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The chest x-ray shows no acute pathology. 
The EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm at 90. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The working diagnosis was peptic 
ulcer disease exacerbation versus gastritis versus non-specific 
abdominal pain.  The patient was status post cholecystectomy five 
years ago.  She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  She did 
not exhibit any stigmata of an acute coronary syndrome; however, 
given her history of diabetes mellitus and her age, an EKG was 
obtained and revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90, without any 
ischemic or infarctive changes.  She was medicated with 30 cc of 
Maalox and 150 mg of Axid, which seemed to improve her pain 
considerably.  Serial abdominal examinations did not reveal any 
peritoneal signs or worsening abdominal pain.  The patient did not 
have any medical records on the computer at this time.  Nursing and 
Triage notes were reviewed and I concur in those findings. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Abdominal pain, suspect gastritis versus peptic 
ulcer disease. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
given abdominal pain instructions in Spanish.  She was given a 
prescription for Axid and for Maalox.  She was to follow up with 
her primary care physician the next day and return if symptoms were 
to recur or worsen.  She was discharged in improved and stable

Seen by Dr. Thrasher and seen and examined by me.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

Currently, being admitted to Internal Medicine.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 66-year-old woman with a

significant medical history including hypothyroidism, history of

high cholesterol, diabetes type 1, hypertension and history of

myocardial infarction in the past and status post cholecystectomy

who presents now with palpitations and shortness of breath.  Her

complaint is that for the last 5 days, she has had this bilateral

neck pain with shortness of breath.  She had no significant chest

pain, but complaining of dull achy pain and dull achy sensation

throughout her throat.  She felt some sensation of her heart

racing with her neck pain.  Mild headache.  No fevers however. 

She has had no diaphoresis or nausea and vomiting.  Blood

pressure initially was 212/76.  Her blood pressure has since then

came down nicely, now is 161/72 and the rest of her vital signs

are normal.

MEDICATIONS:  As would be expected, she is on multiple

medications, which includes captopril, levothyroxine, clonidine

and aspirin as well as nitrates and insulin as well as albuterol

and Lipitor.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had no recent pneumonia or fevers. 

Her shortness of breath is both at rest and with some exertion. 

Again, she had no significant or definitive chest pain per se but

gives history of some neck pain for the last 5 days with some

nausea.  Her palpitations have been intermittent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is comfortable.  Her HEENT exam is

normal.  Her neck is supple without any JVP.  No bruits heard on

neck exam.  Clear lungs with normal breath sounds.  No signs of

failure, no rales.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No

murmurs and no rubs.  Benign abdomen with normal bowel sounds. 

Soft, without any tenderness.  Extremities are normal without any

pedal edema.  Rest of her exam is benign.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray was normal without any evidence of

failure or any acute process.  EKG, some nonspecific T-wave

changes when compared with previous EKGs, there are no new

changes.  Her urinalysis is negative.  Troponin and CK are

normal.  The rest of her labs are all benign.

ASSESSMENT:  A 66-year-old female with shortness of breath,

palpitations and 5-day history of neck pain.  Initially

hypertensive but blood pressure has normalized nicely.  No

widened mediastinum on chest x-ray.  No discrepancy in terms of

her blood pressure in both upper extremities.  Cardiac markers

are flat and EKG is unremarkable.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Treated with aspirin, nitroglycerin

and beta-blocker in the ED.  She is currently symptom free.  She

was also given some morphine sulfate for her pain.  She needs to

CC: Shortness of breath, neck pain.



HPI:  Ms. Riley was recently hospitalized in 11/69 for neck pain, chest pain, and SOB.  She had an extensive cardiovascular work-up that showed no signs of cardiac ischemia.  Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%.  On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s.  Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept.  She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.  SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol.  2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck.  She feels ""her veins exploding"".  Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home.  She says most of her symptoms resolved.  Per her husband, she has always been a fairly anxious person.  



ROS: No DOE, no PND, no fever.  Good apetite, polydypsia. Blurry vision.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  A total thyroidectomy, on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily, COPD, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, cholecystectomy and a meniscal tear.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS (updated)

1) Albuterol inhaler

2) Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily

3) Clonidine HCL 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.

4) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily

5) Flovent 220 mcg b.i.d.

6) Levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily

7) Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily

8) Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily, 

9) Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

10) Humulin 70/30  90 U sc qAM, 70 U sc QPM

11) Metformin 1000 mg PO BID

12) SL NTG 0.3





SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years. Lives with her husband. Denies any tobacco or alcohol.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  

Weight: 215 lbs.  P 73, BP 122/74, SO2 97% RA

Gen: Well nourished.  Apperas well. Not pale. Obese

HEENT: PERRL. MMM. No LAN

Chest: CTA BL

CV: JVP flat. RRR. 2/6 systolic murmur LUSB. no r/g. S1 + single S2.

Abd: Soft. Non-tender. Obese.

Extrem: Warm. 1+ non-pitting edema.





IMPRESSION:  Ms. Riley is a 66-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, evidence of insulin resistance, most recent hemoglobin A1c was 9.4.  Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together.  Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging.  My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD.  Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.   We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.  Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.



In terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.  She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty.  Her next appointment is in January.  HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s.  Last increase in her insluin was in 11/30/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM.  For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her.. 







      

========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================

Discussed with Dr. Freddie Eric. 66 yo woman with poorly controlled DM. Recent admission for R/O MI. A1C was in the 9s. Being followed by Internal Medicine. Has odd sensation of numbness climbing from her toes to her chest associated with SOB and a sense that her neck is exploding. It would appear that she is having anxiety. We will treat with fluoxetine and Klonopin and refer to Psych. We will also adjust her insulin further.

Record date: 2070-11-29

 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman who presents to Internal Medicine for followup.  Since her last visit, she has continued on her regimen of 70/30, 90 units in the morning and up to 90 units at dinnertime (sometimes 1/2 after dinner).  She also uses Lispro 25 units at lunch.  On this regimen, her morning blood sugars have ranged 
Pre-breakfast: 96-214, mostly 100-130.
Pre (sometimes post) Dinner: 128-307, mostly 140-160

The good news is her last A1c dropped to 7.2% from 8.3% (1 year ago was 10.4%)

She has known retinopathy and has had multiple laser treatments.  She goes routinely to the ophthalmologist, at least twice a year and several times a year to the podiatrist as well. She is otherwise in good health, though today she complains of depressed mood, for which she is in therapy. 

On ROS she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, fevers, chills, diarrhea, vaginal or urinary symptoms, numbness or tingling of her lower extremities.  She has not had any hypoglycemia.  She does not exercise.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post total thyroidectomy (because of large goiter) on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily. COPD, obesity, CHF (EF 40%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, status post cholecystectomy.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler, Ambien, atenolol 50 mg daily, clonidine 0.2 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg daily, Flovent b.i.d., levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 20 mg p.o. nightly, Metormin 1000 mg BID, Lasix 20 mg daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years and denies tobacco or alcohol.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing overweight woman.  Blood pressure 117/57, pulse 87, weight 210 down fr 212 last visit, fingersticks 247 postprandial, reports took lispro today.  Extremities, no edema, well perfused with palpable pulses.  No ulcerations or skin breakdown. Microfilament and vibratory sensation intact.  

PREVIOUS DATA:  Labs from 11/22/70: TSH 0.137.  Microalbumin was negative.  Cholesterol was 109, LDL 40, HDL 36, TG 163 A1c 7.2%, down from 8.3% on 7/31/2070 

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  In summary, Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years with poor glycemic control, but significant improvement recently, with latest hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%.

1.  Diabetes.  Her sugars are much improved, as is her A1c. We will switch her 70/30 regular to 70/30 Novolog, given that she gives herself the insulin just after the meals and that she is using Novolog for lunch as well. We emphasized again the pm dose should NOT be pre-bed but pre-dinner.  She will continue dose of 90 units QAM and Qdinner of 70/30 and Lispro 25U for lunch. She will continue on metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She will continue to follow up with Opthalmology and Podiatry.  Her blood pressure is in target range on clonidine and lisinopril.  Her LDL is also in target range on Lipitor.   She will continue on a baby aspirin. Her microalbumin is negative.   

2.  Hypothyroidism.  TSH somewhat suppressed, 0.137, will therefore reduce levothyroxine to 175 mcg QD

She will follow up in 3-4 month's time.

Norma Umali, M.D.
Eldora Nursing Rehab Center
95 Harris Road
Long Beach, VT 26289

Dear Dr. Umali:

Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.  Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.  He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.

Review of systems is negative except as above.  Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.

Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.

Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.

Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.  BP 169/83 and pulse 58.  Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Extremities:  No edema, warm.

Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.  Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.  Skeletal films are pending.

Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD. Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..  He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.  I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.  I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.  However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.

In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.  He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.  Thank you for referring this patient.

Sincerely,

 Medicine Admission Note


Patient Name:  Fay, Brook
MRN: 11289501
Date: 9/16/96
Admitting Staff: Tellez
Location:  59H

Reason for Admission:  Dysphagia

HPI: Ms. Fay is a 69 year-old woman with diabetes who presented from home with an approximately 2 month history of progressive dysphagia, solid and liquid. About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole, presumably for H. pylori eradication (not confirmed); she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling. The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone. She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery. Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well. No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel. She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.

In the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was evaluated by the GI department. A screening HIV test was negative. She was found to have mild hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, as well as a question of subtle ECG changes. The above findings prompted admission for further workup.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives above.

PMH/PSH:   
Diabetes mellitus
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Obesity
GERD
Osteoarthritis and low back pain
H/o AVNRT (2094)

ALLERGIES: Reported rash and facial swelling with Amoxicillin

MEDICATIONS: 
Atenolol 50mg daily
Diclofenac 75 mg Q8 prn
Metformin 500mg PO BID
Pantoprazole 40 mg daily
Loratadine
Albuterol MDI
Meclizine 25mg PRN
Aledronate 70mg weekly

FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone; family heavily involved in her care and assist with secondary ADLs. No alcohol, tobacco or drug use. Born in Peru, last visit about one year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAM:	
Gen: Alert, NAD
VS:  Afebrile   82   100/54   18   100% RA
HEENT:  Conjunctivae clear, anicteric, NP clear, OP with mild thrush, upper dentures; no sinus tenderness
Neck:  Supple, no adenopathy; no palpable thyromegaly
Heart: RRR, s1s2 without murmur
Lungs: CTA bilaterally without wheeze/rales
ABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, nabs, no mass
EXT:  Warm, no edema
Skin: No rash or petechiae
Neuro: A&Ox3, no focal deficits
       
LABORATORY:
15.6 > 42.3 < 487   (77 poly, 17 lymph)
130 / 5.3 / 99 / 21 / 38 / 1.1 < 375   eGFR 48
ALT/AST normal
CK/MG/Troponin normal x 2 sets
UA: 3+ glucose, otherwise negative

MICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture pending

RADIOLOGY: None

ECG: NSR, incomplete RBBB; T wave flattening/inversion in V2-V3 that was not noted on 2094 ECG

IMPRESSION and PLAN: 66 year-old woman with solid/liquid dysphagia, oral candidiasis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia. Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out. The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable. Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms. ECG warrants following. Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.

CV: CR monitor overnight; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers; aspirin, continue beta blocker
Pulm: No issues; albuterol prn
GI: Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning; NPO after midnight; continue home ppi
Endocrine: Sliding scale insulin, metformin; consider diabetes education, and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted. Check HbA1c, TFTs
FEN: Monitor lytes; lowfat ADA diet
Infectious Disease: Following EGD, fluconazole for candidiasis; leukocytosis is unexplained, but not focal evidence of infection
PPx: Enoxaparin may be started after EGD
Social work consult to assess support network and assist with discharge planning

Terry Iyer will assume care in the morning. Please page Dr. Iyer directly at 00450 with questions arising after 8:00am.

                     ZOLLMAN EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT
 
MASSEY,RAMONA   446-90-33-6                       VISIT DATE: 10/07/69
TIME OF DICTATION:  1 p.m. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient is a 63-year-old female who presents to the Zollman Community Clinic Emergency Department from home after the patient 
was found down by her daughter inside her home for an unspecified 
amount of time.  The paramedics and police were called the scene. 
The police were able to force open the door of the home.  The 
patient was found unconscious on the floor, having a generalized 
tonic clonic seizure.  The patient was intubated and given 4 mg of 
Ativan prior to arrival in the Emergency Department with the 
paramedics.  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient 
was noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. 
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.  She has had a 
seizure in the past, apparently secondary to hypoglycemia.  She 
also has a history of high blood pressure.  She is on diltiazem, 
lisinopril, and medications for hypercholesterolemia. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 100.6 degrees F., her 
pulse 150, her respiratory rate 12, her blood pressure on arrival 
205/90, and her O2 saturation is 98%.  On physical examination, the 
HEENT examination reveals a normocephalic head with no evidence of 
trauma on examination.  The pupils are equal and round, weakly 
reactive to light.  The pupils are 2 mm.  The fundi cannot be 
visualized.  The neck is supple.  There are no step-offs noted. 
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has 
normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur.  The abdomen is 
protuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, 
masses, or organomegaly.  The extremities are grossly within normal 
limits.  Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; 
the reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The head CT is noted to be negative.  The 
EKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF.  The heart rate 
is approximately 130.  The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement. 
The troponin I is 2.2, and is in the process of being repeated. 
The glucose is 174, the BUN 57, the creatinine 5.8, the sodium 137, 
the potassium 5.3, the chloride 101, the CO2 18.  The CK is noted 
to be 920, and the CK-MB is 2.6%.  The toxicology screen is 
negative.  The troponin I again is 2.2.  The urine toxicology is 
also noted to be negative.  The white count is 14, the hemoglobin 
11, the hematocrit 36, and the platelet count 350.  The urinalysis 
shows 3+ blood.  There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:   The plan is to admit the patient 
to the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation.  An 
LP will be done in the Emergency Department, and following the LP, 
the patient will be sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  The diagnostic impression in the Emergency 
Department is seizure and coma of undetermined etiology. 
DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  The patient will 
be admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following her lumbar 
puncture.

disease who presented to Emergency Department after an episode of

confusion associated with a blood sugar in the field to 67 (per

EMS) and responsive to orange juice with normal mental status

upon arrival in the ED.  On further history, it seems that the

patient took her usual dose of insulin this morning and ate

breakfast but missed lunch and dinner because of a flood in the

basement that had preoccupied her.  She has had prior episodes of

hypoglycemia associated with skipping meals.  Otherwise, she has

been feeling well.  No recent change in medications.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, CVA/TIA,

and end-stage renal disease (predialysis).

Flovent, and Pravachol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake, alert, sitting up in bed, and

eating supper.  No acute distress.  Temperature 97.2, pulse is

81, respirations 16, blood pressure 170/82, and pulse oximetry

100% on room air.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.

 Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Skin is warm

and well perfused.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented x3 and

nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG:  Without ischemia.  White count 9.4, blood

glucose 93, creatinine 8.5, sodium 140, and potassium 4.9.

 Ms. Greenwood is a 50yo F with DM, HTN, hidradenitis, hyperlipidemia and obesity who presents for routine follow-up.  Since her last visit, she has been to the Windsor Hospital where she was started on ""sea kelp"" lotion for hidradenitis and was told to bathe in salt water and keep the affected areas moist. No longer taking levofloxacin. She is encouraged about this new treatment. These doctors recommended losing 50 lbs, which could help her condition as well.  Because of this, she has been to see the nutritionist today and is eager to lose 40lb. 

Diabetes: as her sugars have been high, she self increased metformin to BID. Has not noticed any side effects. Would like her sugars checked today.

Social Stressors: her husband will be released from jail in November. She intends to move prior to his release. Still involved with psychiatry and passageways. Uses ativan up to 4 times a day for anxiety. Had her meds confiscated by security at Chariton airport as her PICH last name does not match her drivers license.

Trauma: attacked by her cat 5 days ago on her left wrist--using topical antibiotics obtained at Montgomery Infirmary ED.

SHx: volunteering for Computer Sciences Corporation and enjoying the work. Smoking has decreased to 4 per day. Home phone # 249-007-9762

65 Dearborn Street                             Geiger, Xian
Rayne, MI  82978                             01729440
                                              01-14-77 



Mr. Geiger is a 74 year old man who comes in today for follow up of his 
blood pressure medication as well as his cholesterol level.  I have been 
readjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia 
several months ago.  His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg 
q.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d. and atenolol 25mg q.d.  He apparently went 
to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there 
to have high blood pressure.  She prescribed an increase in his atenolol 
from 25mg to 50mg.  He has not yet completed that prescription.  Mr. 
Geiger's blood pressure today is 180/80.  He denies any recent chest 
pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.  

Mr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly 
elevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated.  His 
current cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, 
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, dysuria.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 180/80.  His weight is 184.  
His heart rate is 80.  Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no 
murmurs.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Extremities show no evidence of 
edema.  

Recent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, 
chloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  He has a 
normal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium.  His T4 is 
normal at 10.3.  His THBR is normal at 0.98.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1.   Hypertension.  Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated 
     despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol.  
     He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.  
     I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his 
     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a 
     few weeks for blood pressure check.  
2.   Cholesterol.  The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.  
     Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than 
     130.  Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.  His current 
     liver function tests are normal.

3.   Health maintenance.  I have recommended to him losing some weight.  
     He has gained 6 pounds since his visits last month.  He attributes 
     this to his holiday eating, but he says that he gets a good deal of 
     exercise.  I will continue to recommend diet and exercise for him.  
     He has most recently competed a Pneumovax and a flu vaccine last 
     week.

LLQ pain


HPI: 
Mr. Jay is a 48yo with type II DM c/b diabetic retinopathy, ESRD on HD, bilateral TMA, and HTN who presents with LLQ pain x2 days.
Mr. Jay was seen in the ED the day prior to admission with the same complaint of new onset LLQ pain, which was sharp, non radiating, and most painful with inspiration.  He reports that at this time, he has some mild shortness of breath with the onset of the pain, although this was resolved by the time he was seen in the ED.  He did not complain of any chest pain, palpitations or dipahoresis at that time, although he did have some nausea and vomited once in the ED.  Patient is well known to the ED from prior admissions, and at that time his pain was felt to be 2/2 to throacic radiculopathy/neuropathy 2/2 to his diabetes, however acuity of pain, CT abdomen was performed at that time, which did not reveal any acute patholgy to explain his pain.  He was discharged to home at that time with oral pain medication.  Patient reports that pain did not improve, and was not well controlled with oral pain mediations at home, so he re- presented to the ED.  He does not report any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, cough, back pain, or LE swelling.  Patient is anuric and has been attending dialysis per his usual MWF routine.  


On presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, BP 180s/90s, HR 70s, satting 100% on RA.  He was given IV morphine for his pain, and IV benedryl for nausea (he has had a cyclic vomiting/nausea syndrome on prior admission which has been effectively treated this way).  Patient reported at that time that he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, and that he normally has one every other day.  Rectal exam did not reveal any stool in the vault, and CT scan from the day prior did not show excessive stool or evidence of obstruction or fecal impaction.  However, patient was given dulcolax PR.  He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation and pain control.

The patient was seen and examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 39-year-old man with a 

history of hypertension and diabetes, whose social history is 

unremarkable, who has a negative review of systems, and who has no 

history of any surgical procedures.  He presents with a burn on the 

right side of the neck.  He presents to the emergency department 

with a minor amount of redness on the right side of the neck and 

minor soft tissue swelling.  The trachea is midline.  The uvula is 

midline.  There is no airway compromise.  There are no airway 

complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  No voice change.  The airway is patent and 

intact.  The lungs are clear, with no wheezes.  The examination 

shows a first-degree burn of the right side of the neck, with no 

blistering and no breakage of the skin.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient received a tetanus shot 

and was seen by the Burn Service.  He was dressed with Bacitracin 

and discharged home.  He was to follow up in 48 hours just for a 

recheck.  The Burn Service essentially signed off on him, with no 

need for follow-up, but given this was his neck and only 

first-degree, I asked him to return here for follow-up.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  First-degree burn of the right side of the neck.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is discharged 

with Bacitracin ointment and analgesics, and is to follow up in 48 

hours.  The patient's condition on discharge is stable.

FERRARA,LAUREN   481-85-43-7                       VISIT DATE: 08/07/59

I have examined and treated the patient myself as well as reviewed 

and confirmed the resident's detailed documentation.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this 68-year-old woman 

with a history of diabetes and a past history of ulcers on the 

right foot complains of increased pain on the right leg over the 

past three days.  It was worse yesterday.  It was slightly better 

today.  She has not really been able to get out of bed secondary to 

the pain, whereas she is usually very active.  She denies fever, 

chills, palpitations, and diarrhea.  She has not recently checked 

her blood sugar.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, dementia, 

chronic ulcer of left great toe.  Past surgical history:  

Hysterectomy in the distant past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 70, 

respirations 18.  Blood pressure was initially 241/90.  HEENT:  

Within normal limits.  NECK:  Within normal limits.  LUNGS:  Within 

normal limits.  HEART:  Normal except for a 3/6 systolic ejection 

murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal pulses 

throughout except that most of the pulses are heard only by 

Doppler, and on the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses 

there is no Doppler pulse available.  The lower extremities are 

both cool and somewhat modeled to the mid thigh.  Toes are somewhat 

dusky.  There is a 5 x 5-mm shallow ulcer on the medial aspect of 

the left great toe.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The Orthopedic Service was 

consulted and did AVIs and PVRs which indicated an ischemic lower 

extremity with a question of aortoiliac disease versus thrombus.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedic Service.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Arterial insufficiency.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

being admitted to the Orthopedic Service, is not being heparinized 

at present; and a decision of angiography or MRA will be 

considered.  The patient was admitted to the hospital in stable 

condition.

FERRARA, LAUREN

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.  She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.  Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving.  She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.  According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention.  She denies any significant pain in the leg.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well.  The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever.  The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.  She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.  The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.  The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.  She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing.  The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.  Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery.  The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.  In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things.  There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.  We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.

HPI: Pt is a 56 yo woman with a PMH significant for multiple cardiac risk factors, including IDDM, with a HbA1C of 10.7 earlier this month, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, whose insulin dose was increased 3 weeks ago.  Her blood sugars have subsequently been low, reaching the 50s on several occasions.  At these times, she experiences diaphoresis and dizziness.  The pt took her morning insulin as usual, ate her normal breakfast, and at 4:30pm was walking to the kitchen when she got dizzy and felt her legs    turn to jelly.     She felt herself falling, yelled out to her son and landed on her left arm.  She lost consciousness.  Her son found her unresponsive and witnessed her vomit twice, drool, mumble and lose bladder continence.  She regained consciousness a few minutes later and was placed in an ambulance, where her BS was found to be 91.  She was brought to the DDCH ED, where plain films showed a fractured left humerus and a head CT was negative for bleed.     



She denies CP, SOB or palpitations.  At baseline, the pt is able to walk one mile and climb three flights of stairs without SOB or CP.

Studies:

Plain film humerus- fracture through the diaphysis of the left humerus.  There is lucency which could represent underlying lesion.  

CXR- NAD

Head CT- negative

Assessment: 56 yo woman with chronically high blood sugars, who now, in the setting of recently increased insulin and low blood sugars, presents with fall and LOC, likely a hypoglycemic seizure.



Plan:

Syncope- most likely etiology hypoglycemic seizure.  Given pt's markedly elevated HbA1C, blood sugars likely very high chronically.  Now with tight glycemic control, including blood sugars in the 50s, pt likely seized.  Other worrisome etiologies would include cardiac- has multiple risk factors, but no data supporting CAD (enzymes negative, ECG no change, no signs/symptoms of CHF, no valvular disease, no history of arrhythmias)  Will continue rule out MI.  Don't think TTE necessary.  Also, could be cerebrovascular disease, although imaging of cerebral vasculature has been mostly normal.  Head CT negative for bleed.  Will discuss EEG with pt's neurologist in am.



Left humerus fracture- reduction by ortho in ED.  Pt should sleep in upright position (per ortho).  Percocet for pain control.



DM- have cut pt's home insulin in 1/3 (do not want to run too low).  SSI for additional coverage.

Anemia- stable- iron not deficient.  



Hyperlipidemia- cont statin.

Patient comes in today for follow-up of recent hospitalization for L1 fracture following a fall. She was in her usual state of health until 2 months ago when she suffered a mechanical fall while visiting family in South Korea. She sustained an L1 fracture without surgical intervention, and returned to canada where she presented to the ED on 3/9/76 wiht back pain, L1 planar fracture with evidence of minimal cord compressionl She was admitted and seen by neurosurgery who felt that there was no acute indication for surgery. Since then, she has had continued pain in her back with occasional burning in her feet but no numbness or tingling. She would like to undergo surgery at this point because her pain is intolerable. She is in contact with a neurosurgeon at this time regarding when to proceed with surgery.



She is otherwise doing well. ROS positive for chest tightness with walking one block with some feeling of being ""winded."" She does not have this feeling at rest, and states it has been ongoing for the past year. She describes some peripheral edema, as well as PND.

Assessment and Current Plan:

67 yo F with recent L1 planar fracture and multiple medical problems including HTN and new DM

1.  Neurosurg for possible surgery later this month, percocet for pain control



       - will need PFTs pre-op given some c/o DOE

2.  CV:  will also need nuclear study of heart given anginal sx's and new T wave abnormalities on ECG. Cannot do ETT given resting ECG abnormalities, and will need pharmocologic stress given she cannot walk from back pain.

- will start her on lasix both for BP and for diuresis as she appears volume overloaded.

- will rpt echo if dobutamine MIBI not informative

       

3.optho referral per pt request for eye tearing



        

4.elevated gluc and A1c concerning for new DM. However, given only 1 high b.s documented and A1C borderline elevated, I have advised her that we can probably control this with diet, exercise, and wt loss.She will see nutrition to help her avoid high carb foods and to lose wt . If this fails to control her DM we will start her on Metformin. She will need optho eval for this reason as well.



        5. Pt with strong fhx of uterine ca, wishes to see GYN regarding screening for this. She denies sx's of      vaginal bleeding at this pt.



         6.consider rpt CXR given ?of shadow vs nodule.



         7. will review HM at next visit



Patient will return for a follow-up visit in clinic in 1 wk for chem 7 and 1 month to see me re bp and volume status .

71F w/ multiple medical problems, including dCHF, restrictive lung disease, severe polyarthritis returns to clinic doing significantly better for the most part.

Regarding her shortness of breath, she undewent a stress test which was completely wnl. She has also lost some weight (intentional) and states that, although she still gets short of breath with exertion, it is noticeably better.  She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

For her cough, the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram. The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well.

Regarding her arthritis, he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT.  Her biggest complaint at the moment, though, is her low back pain. She was seen in pain clinic for two injections. She states that the injections may have helped for 1-2 days but then the pain returned. She says this is her most limiting symptom. She is begging for narcotics.

Lastly, she has clear stress urinary incontinence, was cleared for a TOT sling but has now decided to push this procedure off until next spring.

78 yo M with DM, HTN, ulcers, indwelling SPC who presents with one week of feeling &#8220;lousy&#8221; and a maximum temperature of 104 degrees F.  Exam was remarkable for LLE erythema consistent with cellulitis.  Labs were notable for a high WBC with a neutrophilic predominance and a clean urinalysis.  Given his history of fever, exam, and lab studies, infection is the most likely cause of Mr. Flaherty&#8217;s current presentation.  



ISSUE #1: Fever and leukocytosis


Most likely secondary to cellulitis vs wound infection

Blood cultures, urine cultures, wound cultures, and respiratory cultures

Panculture if SPIKES

f/u microbiology c and s

start broad spectrum antibiotics: Vancomycin 1 g q12 IV for presumed MRSA and Unasyn 3000 mg IV q6 for presumed gram negatives (with minimal anaerobe coverage)

if clinically decompensates, will consider Zosyn for pseudomonal coverage and Flagyl for anaerobe coverage



ISSUE #2: Diabetes Mellitus


continue with home regimen of metformin 1000 bid and lantus 14 SC

insulin sliding scale for coverage

Assessment and Plan



Old records requested.



Numerous issues.

Diabetes.  Check glycohgb, microalbumin.  Podiatry and ophthalmology evals.

Cognitive dysfunction.  Suspect on vascular basis given prior stroke and longstanding severe HTN with small vessel disease.  Plan MRI of brain for further characterization

? SCCA of nose.  Derm referral.

L carotid bruit.  Given known cerebrovascular disease needs NICS 

Cardiac.  Obtain old records from cardiologist.  Recent ECHO and stress evals.

Voiding dysfunction.  Check psa.  Likely BPH but could relate in part to cognitive issues.  Begin alpha blocker as he needs better BP control as well.

COMPARISON: 12/22/86          FINDINGS:     Lines/tubes:  None.          Lungs and pleura:  There is continued right mid and lower chest     opacity consistent with loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis.     This appearance of fluid has decreased slightly since the previous     study. There is no  pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is     demonstrated in the left hemithorax.  There may be a small     posterior left pleural effusion as well. There is subtle     suggestion of Kerley B lines at the lung bases consistent with     mild CHF.          Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are     unchanged from the prior study. The aortic arch is calcified and     tortuous.          Bones:  The thoracic skeleton is unchanged from the prior study.          IMPRESSION:     Continued signs of atelectasis and pleural fluid involving     predominantly the right mid and lower hemithorax.  The appearance     of this has improved slightly since the prior exam.  No new focal     consolidation is demonstrated compared to the prior study.          There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines consistent with mild     CHF.     Plan:
1. Recurrent pleural effusion: for repeat CT chest. Continue treatment for CAP.
2. Hematuria: hold off Coumadin at present. Monitor Foley drainage. Consult Urology if no resolution. Otherwise for outpatient follow-up.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Alert Dr Joyce of admission as courtesy.
4. A Fib: rate controlled at present. Hold off Coumadin. 
5. HTN: BP poorly controlled. For admission anti-hypertensives. Monitor.
6. Psych: he appears depressed. Likely reactive to current poor health. I will alert PCP.
7. Code: FULL
8. Family: Daughter present and aware of plan

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Mr. Jimenez is a 78 yo male with h/o Hodgkin&#8217;s dz s/p chemo, T2m, HTN, AAA, CHF (last TTE 2086 with LVEF 50%, RVSP 45), a fib on coumadin, recently discharged after prolonged hospital stay for PNA &amp; complicated pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, now returns from rehab with 20 lb wt gain since discharge on 3/09 &amp; 7.5 lbs since 3/20 &amp; increasing pleural effusion.  Increasing wt gain could be secondary to low ext edema. ?right heart failure 2/2 to pulm htn or perhaps diastolic dysfunction; however BNP not very elevated.  Patient&#8217;s albumin is only slightly below 3.4 as well.  Low suspicion for DVTs given exam with bilateral low ext swelling &amp; recent negative LUE noninvasive.


1.      Low ext edema/wt gain: Patient responding well to IV lasix from ED.
a.     Trial of daily PO lasix
b.     Strict I/O/s, daily wt
c.     Consider a repeat TTE, but recently performed 5 months ago so expect little change.
2.      Loculated pleural effusion:  With effusion enlarging, question if patient would be candidate for decortication/pleurodesis.
a.     Consider thoracic surgery consult
3.      ID: Will hold on further antibiotics at this time.  Afebrile without elev WBC.  Suspect CXR showing increasing pleural effusion.  Low suspicion for PNA.
4.      CV:
a.     Rhythm: Rate control with digoxin, labetalol.  Hold coumadin for elevated INR.  Restart when &lt;3.3.
b.     HTN: Cont Norvasc, labetalol, hydralazin, lisinopril
c.     PVD: Cont statin, ASA
5.      T2DM: Cont NPH 6 units BID + RISS


F/E/N:  No conc sweets.


PROPHYLAXIS:
GI: Not indicated.                
DVT: Coumadin
BOWEL: OBR


CODE:  FULL

Abdominal CT Renal no hydronephrosis/renal masses.
Dilated loops of bowel/ no masses/ consistent with SBO

Assessment and plan:
Patient with recurrent SBO. Unfortunately she has had vomiting X 4-5 days, and now has acute renal failure, most likely due to hypotension, dehydration and ATN

Her psychiatric problem is significant. 
Hold HCTZ/ ACE
IV hydration. Renal consult.
NG suction for SBO.
Dr Xenakis back tomorrow.

Review of Systems:   The following systems reviews were contributory: endocrine
[pertinent positives:  diabetes mellitus]; cardiovascular [pertinent positives:
 hypertension, occasional light headed ness; pertinent negatives:  chest pain
with exertion, chest pain at rest, dyspnea on exertion, peripheral edema];
gastrointestinal [pertinent positives:  diarrhea] and urinary tract [pertinent
positives:  nocturia, urgency].     The following systems reviews were
noncontributory: general; psychological and musculoskeletal.

General Examination
-------------------------------

6/08/2158 1:31 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 100/42 and  his
pulse was 60 per minute  when lying; his blood pressure was 80/40 and  his
pulse was 64 rrr per minute  when sitting.  The orthostatic change was
symptomatic.  He appeared well-nourished and well-groomed.
6/08/2158 1:36 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 90/40 when
sitting.

Rating Scales:
UPDRS Subscale III (Motor Examination):  Subscale total score was 22 out of
108.  This subscale was completed while the patient was ON.

Tremor at rest was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 0 in the
face, 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity, 0 in the
right lower extremity, 0 in the left lower extremity,.

Action or postural tremor of the hands was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0
being absent): 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity,.

Rigidity was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 1 in the right
upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity, 1 in the right lower extremity,
1 in the left lower extremity,.

The following movements were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being normal): 
    Finger Taps: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity;
    Hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper
extremity;
    Rapid alternating hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the
left upper extremity;
    Leg agility: 1 in the right lower extremity, 2 in the left lower extremity.

Each of the following was rated on a 0-4 scale (with 0 being normal):
    Speech:  1 (slight loss of expression, diction and/or volume);
    Facial expression:  1 (minimal hypomimia; could be normal 'pokerface');
    Arising from a chair:  1 (slow or may need more than one attempt);
    Posture:  1 (not quite erect, slightly stooped posture; could be normal for
older person);
    Gait:  2 (walks with difficulty but requires little or no assistance; may
have some festination, short steps, or propulsion);
    Postural stability:  1 (retropulsion, but recovers unaided);
    Body bradykinesia and hypokinesia:  2 (mild degree of slowness & poverty of
movement that is definitely abnormal; alternatively, some reduced amplitude).

Assessment:  
  1.  Parkinson's Disease:  Parkinson with decline in strength and endurance.
It is possible that the added  Sinemet is causing a decrease in his blood
pressure. I made a referral to Mary Darnell PT here at TMH. In addition Dr
Edward Nguyen felt a slight reduction of the Sinemet to 1.5 tab QID may help his
blood pressure with out changing his motor ability. RTC 1 month Dr Edward Nguyen
and 2 months Genevieve Noland, NP


Recommendations:

Medication given:
  Sinemet 25/100: 2 tab po qid.


Medication changes included:
   Stopped:
  pyridoxine 50 mg: 1 tab po qd;

  Sinemet 25/100: 1.5 tab po qid.

   Started:
  6/08/2158 Sinemet 25/100: 1.5 tab po qid.

This patient's history, physical examination, assessment and recommendations
were completed by  Genevieve Noland, NP.

Reason for Visit	

Mr. Whitehead is here for FU of his many issues.





Problems	  

benign prostatic hypertrophy	      

PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70 and 3.0 in 2/72.   He has done well on flomax and now sees Dr. Pena.



hyperlipidemia	      

now on lipitor 40 mg qhs.  He has NIDDM and HTN.  His lipid profile from 4/71 showed a LDL of 103.  LFT were normal.  Will check lab  work and continue med.  

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and has seen Dr. Lozano in diabetic unit.  His HBA1c was 7.5 in 6/71 and 7.6 in 9/71 on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage XR 500 mg qd.   He is on zestoretic.  Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace-inh.  His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor.  He has no neuropathic sx's and sees ophtho regularly.  

HYPERTENSION	      

Now on zestoretic 20/25 bid + atenolol 50 mg qd.  He has significant white coat component.  BP is again 145/80 and is lower at home.  Pulse is 70 but it again sped up when he was being examined.



LOW BACK PAIN	      

he had prolonged discogenic back pain in 1/2070 and could not get appt with NAMG orthopedic/back surgeon and went to Montreal Medical Center.  He underwent L4/5 lamenictomy in 2/2070.  He has persistent right-lower back pain and has seen Drs. Conley and Sheehan.  A myleogram done on 8/5/71 showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4/5.  He continues to have chronic low back pain in the right hip and right anterior thigh.  He exercises regularly and has not benefitted from prior epidural injection.  Dr. Sheehan felt that pain may be from some instability vs scar tissue from prior surgery.  Fusion surgery was discussed but Mr. Whitehead is not too keen on it. [12/25/71]



still has back pain but not ready for fusion surgery yet.



Review of Systems	

Otherwise negative.

      Team A Intern Admit Note

Patient Name: Tammy Umphrey

MR#  0942207

Date of Admission:  8/26/66

Attending: Yoel Pollard

PCP:  Susan Ullom



CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status



HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)  Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.  She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66. Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.  She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.

	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed. However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.  8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear. U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin. There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.  Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.  Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days. She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.

	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus. She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.



PMH: (Per chart- pt unable to provide history)

1.    S/P  aneurysm rupture, suboccipital craniotomy for microsurgical trapping and   clipping

Microbiology:





CXR:	The findings are consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension with possible early interstitial edema.



Head CT:  1. No significant change compared to prior CT Brain-04/18/2066.

	No change in ventricle size.   No acute infarct; although, this is

	better assessed with MR with diffusion.

	2.  Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale

	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due

	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup.



EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals. Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam. No evidence of acute ischemia.



Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.



Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source. Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66. Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.

-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures

-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism

UTI

-likely UTI- tx

-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source

-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic

-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data

-change foley now

-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics

Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status

-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection

-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm. If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic. If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.

DM

-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements

Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH

GI/FEN- ranitidine BID, glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary

HTN-continue home medications

wound care consult requested for report of decubitus ulcer

Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine

693-31-18-1



I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.  The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.



He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.  In August he suffered a stroke.  He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.  He recalls no problem with his vision.  He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.  He does no know the extent of the evaluation.  He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.  He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.  His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.  He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.  He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.  The dizziness is worst in the morning.  He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.



He has DM and HTN.  He is a nonsmoker.  I don't have cholesterol information.  There is no history of cardiac disease.  There is no history of alcohol abuse.



He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.  He has no known allergies.



He is aware of no significant family history.



He is married.  He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.  He came to america from Honduras in 2073.  He worked nights in construction until his stroke.



Pulse 66, regular.  BP 186/110.  There are no cranial bruits.  The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.  The lungs are clear.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.  He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.  His fluency in his native language is probably normal.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.  (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)  Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.  The tone is only mildly increased.  Sensation is intact.  Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).  The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.  Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.  He wears a right AFO.  He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.



His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.  This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.  He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.  Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.



To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.  I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.  He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.  He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.  I asked him to return here in a month to review this.





Sincerely,







Patrick Winn, M.D.

EDVISIT^06129040^MACK, ROSE^08/16/92^GRAHAM, ANGELA

This patient's visit was shared with PA, Quiring.  I also

personally interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female with

past medical history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of an

infected left heel ulcer.  The patient is status post bypass

grafting in her lower extremities and skin grafting of a

nonhealing ulcer on her right heel.  Since that time, she has

developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer on the left heel, which has

been followed closely by VNA.  Today, she was seen by her VNA who

was very concerned about redness and swelling of her left foot

with redness that extended underneath the plantar surface of the

foot and over the dorsal surface and concern for infection of

this ulcer.  The patient has minimal sensation in the left foot. 

She states sometimes she can feel a pressure sensation.  She does

have some pain when she tries to weightbear, has not noted any

fevers, has noted some chills and states that her fingerstick

earlier today was elevated.  She denies any abdominal pain,

nausea, or vomiting.  She does note that her foot does appear to

be somewhat slightly more swollen but has not noticed redness up

until today.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for hypothyroidism, type 1

diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease with a nonhealing

diabetic foot ulcers.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She is status post femoral bypass

grafting, thyroidectomy, skin grafting for nonhealing wounds, and

right foot debridement in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smoked in the past, does not drink.  She

lives with family, is followed by a VNA, and is not working.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems reviewed and otherwise

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin.

ALLERGIES:  She has an allergy to codeine, aspirin, erythromycin,

oxycodone, and sulfa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 105,

respirations 16, blood pressure 117/70, and O2 saturations are

100% on room air.  The patient is awake, alert, frail, and thin

female.  She is in no respiratory distress.  Her head examination

is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her conjunctivae are slightly

pale.  She has moist mucous membranes.  The airway is patent. 

Her neck is supple with full range of motion without any pain. 

The trachea is midline.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation

bilaterally with equal breath sounds.  No respiratory distress,

no accessory muscle use, and no chest wall tenderness.  Her

cardiac examination is tachycardic and regular at about 100 with

a 3/6 systolic murmur.  Her abdomen is nondistended, soft, and

nontender.  No guarding and no peritoneal signs.  Her skin is

remarkable for healing superficial ulcers on the right heel.  On

the left heel, she has a superficial ulcer with a dark eschar,

which is approximately 4 x 4 cm in diameter.  There is no

purulent discharge around the area; however, the skin of the left

foot is fairly violaceous and warm on the plantar surface of the

foot surrounding the ulcer extending up the lateral aspect of the

foot to the anterior aspect of the left ankle was demarcated in

the Emergency Department.  There is no other break in the skin

visualized.  Her back is nontender with full range of motion. 

Extremities are remarkable for lower extremity atrophy.  She does

have 1+ edema of both feet.  She has minimal sensation on

palpation of her feet with no obvious tenderness on palpation

over her left foot.  Her pulses are trace.  She is alert and

oriented x3, has a depressed affect.  See the PA note for

remainder of the details of the physical examination.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access

initiated.  Laboratory studies were sent including blood

cultures.  She was started on IV antibiotics, vancomycin, and

gentamicin and was consulted to Vascular Surgery.  Her feet

remained elevated.  She had a plain x-ray performed of her foot,

which showed no obvious evidence of osteomyelitis and no

subcutaneous gas.  Her laboratory studies are remarkable for

hyperglycemia and she was started on IV fluids.

DISPOSITION:  She is admitted to Surgery.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left foot, nonhealing ulcer with left foot

cellulitis, and peripheral vascular disease.

See the note for details.

Infectious Disease Consult Note 


Pt: Rose Mack
MR#: 06129040

Consult Date: 3/19/94



CC/RFC: 
Pt is a 52 year old w/ chronic R heel wound, now w/ wound infection. Consultation was requested by Dr. Katz for recommendations regarding antibiotic management.



HPI:  Pt has longstanding DM and PVD complicated by severe R foot ulceration. She underwent R femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft in 5/92 and skin grafting in 7/92. R heel wound subsequently improved but pt developed L plantar ulceration requiring debridement 10/92. Cultures grew MSSA. Pt was subsequently treated w/ extended course of doxycycline, rifampin through 2/93. She subsequently did well until developing R heel ulcer while undergoing psychiatric hospitalization in mid 2/94. She was initially hospitalized at Altadena Hospital, where she underwent debridement of wound and treatment w/ extended course of penicillin VK and probenicid. Wound failed to improve. Pt was rehospitalized on 3/18 at GCCfor further management. She underwent incision and debridement on 3/18. Intraoperative evaluation revealed ulcer wound tracking to bone. Intraoperative gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs. Intraoperative cultures are pending. Pt was subsequently treated w/ vancomycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole. 




On interview, pt reports feeling generally well. No F/C/NS. Appetite normal. Had  previously noted creeping erythema up R leg, now resolved.

Impression
52F w/ DM, PVD and hx of R heel ulceration s/p skin grafting in 5/92 and L midfoot MSSA infection in 9/92, now w/ relapse of R heel ulceration. Intraoperative cultures show involvement of bone. Clinical picture is concerning for osteomyelitis. Possible culprit organisms include drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which should be treated empirically while awaiting cultures. Pt will likely require an extended course of IV therapy for treatment of osteomyelitis.



Recommendations

 



Follow up intraoperative cultures

Continue vancomycin 1g IV Q24H; check trough prior to fourth dose.

Discontinue levofloxacin, metronidazole.

NAME:    Werner, Brian  

MRN:     4097229



This patient reports approximately 3-4 years ago he had episodes of right sided

visual loss.  He thought it was only related to his right eye.  What he describes is a

right peripheral hemispheric visual loss.  He reports having a history of headaches

in the past.  It is nothing that is significantly worse than usual.  On Thursday he

reports having a mild bitemporal headache and then later that day ensuing right

peripheral loss that has lasted for the past 3-4 days.  In the past his visual loss only

lasted for about one day.  He denies any other focal neurological complaints.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  He is on a baby aspirin a day.  He

denies any further headaches.  He denies any numbness, tingling or weakness on

one side of his body or other.  He has chronic left knee problems from an old

injury.  He is unable to bend the leg.  He has no new problems with his gait.  He

denies any symptoms of jaw claudication.  



PHYSICAL EXAM:  His exam reveals no temporal artery tenderness to palpation. 

His funduscopic exam appears normal on undilated exam.  His visual fields reveals

what appears to be consistent with right bilateral hemianopsia.  PERRLA.  EOMI. 

Cranial nerves II-XII are otherwise intact.  His motor strength is 5/5.  He has no

pronator drift.  His cerebellar exam is intact.  His blood pressure is 150/100.

Carotid - no bruit.  Cor - RRR no MGR Lungs - CTA

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Question bilateral hemianopsia.  The patient will get

scheduled for an MRI/MRA as soon as possible.  He was sent to the NDMG
Ophthalmology Clinic to confirm bilateral vs. unilateral hemianopsia (central vs. peripheral etiology) today for further evaluation plus/minus ESR and CBC at

that point in time.

Chief Complaint	

Mrs Chapman  is here today to follow up on HTN, DM 



History of Present Illness	

I saw her 2/24/87 for HTN and DM. BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD

Restarted Lipitpr but she still is not taking it. The pharmacy didn't give it to her. Her LDL is 116 ono 2/87 and has DM, goal <100.

Feels well. 

Had an ETT MIBI few weeks ago and no evidence of ischemia.

Denies CP, SOB, palpitations

Started walking daily around Woodstown about 3.5 miles and has lost 7 pounds since I saw her. Also eating more vegetables and fruits and less carbohydrates.



Third, she had a renal U/S done for hematuria and showed small left renal mass. Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI. She had it done few 9/86. Recommended to repeat it soon. Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2. However, when compared to prior CT examination demonstrating late filling of this lesion, follow up is warranted to exclude a cystic renal neoplasm making this an overall bosniak grade 2F. 





Review of Systems	

C/P: Denies PND, orthopnea. Leg swelling after walking around the pond

Has had intermittent, fluctuating symptoms of cough/DOE since then.  10d prior, seen at VGH ED and was discharged w/ prednisone (7d course).  He reports that his symptoms never improved on prednisone.  At baseline, he is able to walk 40-50y flat ground and several flights of stairs; limited by dyspnea.  Now, has dyspnea at rest and cannot climb 1 flight of stairs.  Saw his PCPs NP on the day of admission and was referred to WMC.  Denies clear precipitant, denies sick contacts, h/o seasonal allergies. 

In the ED, VS: T 98.1 HR 100-114 BP95/55-172/79 RR24-36 O2sat 96%4L.  He was noted to be visibly dyspneic, wheezes on exam w/ an irregular heartbeat.  He was transferred to trauma for close observation of respiratory status, although he did not require PPV or ABG.  BNP 136, cardiac markers neg x 1.  WBC returned at 17.5.  AP CXR was indeterminate for clear PNA.  Patient was started on albuterol/atrovent nebs, solumedrol 125mg, ceftriaxone/azithromycin for possible PNA.

EKG tachycardia, at least two atrial foci. RBBB.
CXR L lower lung opacity. Poor film.

Impression/Plan: 
87yoM h/o COPD, vascular disease p/w SOB, cough.  Likely COPD flare.  High WBC may be steroids, but CXR too poor to rule out PNA.  Otherwise, no clear precipitant.  Failed steroids as outpatient (dosing unclear).  Given level of dyspnea, will treat w/ solumedrol for now, and transition to prednisone when improvement/trajectory is clear.  Patient may need a longer taper than over 10d.

SOB: COPD flare +/- PNA.
	-repeat CXR in AM.
-solumedrol 125mg q6 for now.  Transition to prednisone 1mg/kg when clinically stable.  Follow trend, decide on length of taper at later date.
-advair, spiriva.  Standing albuterol nebs q4 for now.  Space nebs when improvement demonstrated.
-keep O2 sats 88-92%
CHEST PRESSURE: follow for now.  Would deserve stress.  Unless  has more activity/symptoms while here, would defer to be done as outpatient.  Does have significant risk factors.
	-ROMI by markers.
	-telemetry.
	-ASA, ARB, statin.
	-start low dose beta-blocker to see if he tolerates.
HTN: likely exacerbated by steroids.  Will be moving target in setting of changing steroid dose.
	-c/w home ARB.
	-start lopressor 25 tid for now.
	-hydralazine 25mg q6h for immediate decrease in BP now.  Taper off when able.
DM2: no meds from home
	-RISS, FS qid.
	-check A1c.
FEN: no added salt, low cholesterol/fat, no conc sweets
PROPHY: fragmin, zantac.
CODE: full code (confirmed w/ patient)
DISPO: PT eval.

Attending Admission Note

HPI:  54 year old woman with h/o DM, HTN, and depression who is transferred to PSH from Missouri Baptist Hospital after being admitted from 2/15-2/20/83 and then readmitted on 2/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis.  She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through.  All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study.  She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect.  She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping.  The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well.  The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.  She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so.  The pain is not necessarily related to eating.  Yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat.  Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10.  She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.
	At Missouri Baptist Hospital, her MS Contin was held, but when her BP went up, she was restarted on it.  They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN.  It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1.  However, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 11.1.

     S/S ABD PAIN, NAUSEA/VOM, PLS ASSESS FOR OBSTRUCTION

REPORT:
     This study was reviewed by Dr. Yee and Dr. Janssen.
     HISTORY: As provided in the header.
     COMPARISON: 10/31/2081
     TECHNIQUE:
     Contiguous axial CT scans of both the abdomen and pelvis were
     performed from the lung bases to the proximal femora to assess for
     obstruction.
     Imaging was continued into the pelvis because a charge can affect
     both cavities.
     Abdominal and pelvic images were obtained following administration
     of both oral and intravenous contrast.
     FINDINGS:
     LUNG BASES. Linear densities in the lung bases likely represents
     atelectasis.
     HEPATOBILIARY.
     Liver. The liver is normal in appearance without evidence of
     biliary ductal dilatation or focal lesion.
     Gallbladder and Bile Ducts. Patient status post cholecystectomy.
     Pancreas. Normal in appearance.
     BOWEL. There is no evidence of the obstruction or bowel wall
     thickening.  A moderate amount of stool seen in the colon and
     rectum.
     GENITOURINARY:
     Kidneys. Normal in appearance without evidence of renal calculus
     or hydronephrosis.
     Ureters and bladder. Normal in appearance.
     Adrenal glands. Normal in appearance.
     Pelvic organs. Vascular calcifications are noted the pelvis.
     PERITONEUM:No evidence of fluid collection, free air or peritoneal
     mass lesions.
     RETROPERITONEUM:
     Lymph nodes. There are a few small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes
     present without bulk.
     Vessels.  Unremarkable.
     BONES AND SOFT TISSUES. Partial sacralization of L5.
     IMPRESSION.
     No evidence of obstruction.

REPORT:
     A gastric emptying study was performed using eggs labeled with 17
     MBq technetium 99m sulfur colloid.  There was no evidence of
     gastroesophageal reflux over 60 minutes of observation.  Gastric
     emptying was reduced, showing only 9% emptying at 60 minutes and
     29% emptying at 90 minutes.
     Impression
     Reduced gastric emptying with 29% emptying of a solid meal at 90
     minutes after ingestion.

REPORT:
     Image interpretation reviewed by Dr. Narvaez.
     TECHNIQUE:
     A single contrast small bowel series.
     FINDINGS:
     On small bowel follow through, the small bowel loops are normal in
     caliber and distribution. Spot compression views of the terminal
     ileum are normal. The transit time was normal.
     

IMPRESSION
     NORMAL SMALL BOWEL SERIES.
     
Assessment and Plan	
54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.  Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.
1.  GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.  Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.  Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.  She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.  Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.  We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.  She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.  We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.
2.  HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).  Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.  In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.
3.  DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.  Will monitor BS.
4.  Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.

History compiled from patient's record and son

CC:  altered mental status



HPI:  83yo female with a h/o dementia, HTN, DM, Afib, PMR, and chronic diarrhea sent from her assisted living facility for altered mental status and suspected UTI.  Per the patient's son, the staff at her facility has noted the patient to be more confused over the last 3 days.  She has had more frequent episodes of fecal incontinence with soiling of her bed and carpet. Some blood was also noted in her toilet. Her son also reports that she has been less awake than usual and has had some congestion and coughing.  She has had no fevers, chills, chest pain, sob, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. A urinalysis was reportedly positive at her assisted living facility and the patient was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. 



At baseline, the patient is generally quite confused.  She knows her name and often location but not the date/year and talks frequently of her late husband and parents whom she believes are still alive. Her assisted living facility has recently suggested that she be transferred to their higher level of care program.



ED: T 98.1, P 110, R 20, BP 130/56, SaO2 98% RA. She has dry MM. Lungs clear. Heart irregular. AAOx1 and otherwise nonfocal neuro exam. Her initial labs were notable for a Hct of 44.6 which was 34.5 on repeat. Rectal exam brown stool guaiac positive. CXR showed no sign of pneumonia. Urinalysis was negative for any signs of infection. Blood cultures were sent. The patient was treated with levofloxacin 500mg po and 3LNS, as well as many of her home meds, including Lopressor, Sotalol, prednisone, iron, thiamine, folic acid, mvi, calcium, glyburide, and effexor. Aspirin was held. She was transfused one unit of PRBCs and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

A/P:  83 yo female with dementia, HTN, DM, AF, and PMR with worsening mental status over several days. Per report, her urinalysis was positive at her living facility, however there is no evidence of urinary or other infection now (now WBC or fever; CXR neg, Ucx/Blcx NG). Suspect her altered mental status is secondary to progressive dementia and dehydration. The patient was also noted to have blood in her stool at home and a 10 point Hct drop in the emergency department. While the patient did get 3L of fluid in between which could cause dilutional anemia, given the patient's history of blood in stool and guaiac positivity, will work-up possible GI bleed. 



1.	Decreased Hct- GIB v. dilutional.  Does have h/o diverticulitis.

a.	Serial Hcts q8

b.	2 large bore IVs at all times

c.	Consider GI consult if Hct continues to drop for possible EGD/colonoscopy (although pt has had multiple unsuccessful colonoscopy attempts in past)

d.	Nexium 40mg po qd

2.	AMS- likely progressive dementia in setting of dehydration. 

a.	F/u urine and blood cultures

b.	Hold antibiotics as no clear source of infection

c.	Check TSH, B12, folate, LFTs, lytes

d.	Hydrated in ED

e.	Check head CT

f.	Attempt to wean effexor; consult geri-psych per attending

3.	Rhythm- has h/o afib and SVT, now in aflutter with variable block. HR goes up with activity and when due for meds.

a.	Cont lopressor, sotalol, digoxin

b.	Hold aspirin for possible GIB

c.	Telemetry monitoring

4.	Hyperlipidemia- statin recently increased

a.	Check fasting lipids

b.	LFTs

5.	Diabetes- glyburide recently increased. Will hold for now in case needs to be NPO.

a.	RISS coverage

b.	Check HbA1c

6.	PMR- Cont Prednisone 5mg po qd; would like to try to taper if possible

7.	FEN- appears euvolemic now. Diabetic diet.

8.	Prophy- no fragmin/heparin. Pneumoboots. Nexium.

9.	Dispo- consult physical therapy

10.	Code- FULL CODE, discussion with son

as well as Dr. Xanders, on May 02, 2106.  Please see note for full 

details, reviewed in full.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Leg swelling and pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old female who 

is on chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis, who comes in 

with left leg swelling and pain going on for two days, and she was 

sent in for evaluation.  There has been no change in range of 

motion.  She has been able to ambulate, but with difficulty and 

limping.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does have a history of Staphylococcus 

aureus infection of the right side.  She also has 

non-insulin-dependent diabetes, vasculitis and neuropathy.  She is 

status post multiple joint operations.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  No tobacco or ETOH.  She lives 

alone.  Family history is noncontributory.   Please see the 

resident's note for the rest of the details.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Awake, alert, very pleasant female 

in no apparent distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Her temperature is 98.  Her 

normal temperature is about 96.5.  She is not tachycardic.  

EXTREMITIES:  Her exam is notable for some shininess to the skin, 

some redness and some swelling.  Distally neurovascularly intact.  

Full range of motion of her knee and ankle above and below the area 

at her baseline.  She does have a total knee replacement on that 

side.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Cellulitis.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  We are concerned 

that she may have a DVT.  We are going to admit her to our 

observation unit to give her antibiotics.  We will discuss her case 

with Dr. Keane, her primary care physician, and likely discharge 

her in the morning with improvement as long as she does not have a 

DVT.  If she has a DVT we will add on subcutaneous enoxaparin to 

her medical regimen.  The patient is currently in satisfactory 

condition.

Neurology Clinic Follow-up



ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections



HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.  Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.  The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.  Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.  Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.  He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.  Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.



His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.



The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.  The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.  He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.  Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.  The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.  This may represent abscess.  Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.  Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.  Patient denies fever or chills.  He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.  This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.



Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.  He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.  His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.  He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.  His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.  While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.  He cries when he tells me about this.  A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.  He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.  His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.  There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.



He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.  An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.  He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.  Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.  They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses. 



PMHx:

-stroke as above

-HTN

-hyperlipidemia

-DM



Meds:

-Zestril 5

-trazodone 150

-Avandia 4

-Glucophage 1000 bid

-insulin

-Neurontin 400 bid

-Zantac

-Lopressor 50 bid

-Dilaudid 2 tid

-Lidoderm patch to L shoulder

-Pravachol 20

-Paxil 20

-folate, B vitamins



All:  Allegra -> unknown reaction



SoHx:  Lives with daughter and female friend.  Former RN.  No substance use of any kind.



Exam:

Gen - BP 120/75.  Pulse 56 and regular.  Well-appearing.

MS - alert and fully oriented, fluent and conversant, attentive, aware of current events.  Mood is labile with crying or laughing as appropriate.

CN - PERRL, EOMI, VFF with marked left-sided visual neglect, L face droop, tongue midline, SCM strong, unable to elevate shoulder on left, facial sensation intact

Motor - 5/5 strength throughout on right, L arm flaccid with 0/5 strength throughout, L leg with 2-3/5 proximal strength, otherwise 0/5 

Sens - intact to light touch throughout with marked extinction to DSS

Reflex - brisk on the left side with upgoing toe; otherwise normal

Coord - normal FNF on the left

Gait - hemiplegic with circumduction of left leg, quite stable with cane



Imp/Plan:   s/p R MCA stroke with hemicraniectomy, recovering nicely.  Potentially infected fluid collection at site of hemicraniectomy.  No evidence of systemic infection.  Subluxation of L shoulder.

1.  Admit for neurosurgical management as discussed.  Bone prosthesis will be placed at some point in the future (when possibility of infection is definitively ruled out or treated).

2.  Should be on aspirin for stroke/MI prophylaxis, but will discuss with Dr. Bennett before starting.

3.  Continue aggressive BP/lipid management.

4.  For neuropathic pain in the shoulder, will try Elavil 25 qhs.  Patient will stop trazodone.  If Elavil is helpful, may increase to 50 qhs after one week of therapy.  Once Elavil up to 50 qhs, would slowly taper Neurontin as per patient and family preference.  At next appointment, if persistent left arm paralysis (which is likely), will encourage surgical fusion of the shoulder.

5.  Follow-up in 3 months.
