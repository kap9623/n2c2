Har is a 43 year old 6' 214 pound gentleman who is referred for
consultation by Dr. Harlan Oneil.  About a week ago he slipped on
the driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle. 
He was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a
fracture.  He was placed in an air splint and advised to be
partial weight bearing, and he is using a cane.  He is here for
routine follow-up. 
Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. 
He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.  He takes Prozac,
Cardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.  He is also followed by Dr. Harold
Nutter for an arrhythmia.  He does not smoke.  He drinks
minimally.  He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.
 
On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle
about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.  The malleolus is
non-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness
either.  Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. 
There is no significant swelling.  There are no some skin changes
with some small abrasions proximally.  There is no fibular
tenderness proximally.  No anterior pain is noted.  No hindfoot,
midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. 
I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.  He is
using a cane for ambulation.  His x-rays do not show a notable
fracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion. 
I would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.  I will
see him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office. 
 
 
Diagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.

VALDEZ,HARLAN,JR.   845-41-54-4                VISIT DATE: 03/14/08

The patient was seen and examined in the emergency department.  The 

patient was seen by the Emergency Medicine resident.  I have 

discussed the management with the resident.  I have also seen the 

patient primarily and reviewed the medical record.  This is a brief 

addendum to the medical record.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 45-year-old 

male who complains of several days of nausea, vomiting, and left 

lower quadrant discomfort.  He also describes intermittent chest 

pain, which he has had for a number of months without significant 

change.  He was sent in from his primary care doctor today with 

this pain and was also noted to have some EKG changes.  The patient 

has no chest pain at the time of evaluation in the emergency 

department and no shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is very 

well-appearing, a smiling, very pleasant gentleman in no acute 

distress.  The blood pressure is 119/90, the pulse 82, and the 

temperature 97.9 degrees.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The chest 

is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm. 

The abdomen is soft.  He has left lower quadrant tenderness.  He 

also, of note on cardiovascular examination, has a soft murmur 

which he says he has had since childhood.  The extremities are 

normal.  The neurologic examination is non-focal. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is a gentleman with abdominal 

pain who will receive a CAT scan to rule out diverticulitis.  He 

has also had some non-specific ST changes on his EKG.  He is 

pain-free at this time.  He does not describe a classic exertional 

pattern for his chest pain, but given that he is a diabetic and 

with EKG changes, he will also be admitted for rule out MI.  A CT 

is pending at the time of this dictation.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The 

patient's condition is currently stable.

RE: VALDEZ, Harlan 
DHN#: 7672624 
DATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 
CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
 
Dear Vicente, 
 
Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.  
 
He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.   
He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.  
 
Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted.  
 
There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep. There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.  
 
The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep"".  
 
Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"". The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.  
 
Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day"".  If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.  
 
The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  
1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN.  
2. Lithium.  
3. Valproate.  
4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d.  
5. Humulin 15 units at night.  
6. Folate.  
7. Metoprolol.  
8. Cardia.  
9. Vitamin E.  
10. Coated aspirin.  
 
ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.   
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.  
 
On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.  
 
HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.  
 
The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted.  
 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).  
2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above.  3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.  
 
PLAN:  
1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.  q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.  
2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.  
3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.  
Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.  
4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  
5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   
Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.  
 
Sincerely yours,

CC: Chest Pain    Cath    VF arrest    RCA stenting



History of Present Illness (obtained on admission):  Pt is a 48 yo male with h/o DMII, hypercholesterolemia, Bipolar d/o, and depression who began to have sub-sternal day prior to admission in car and pre-syncope + profound weakness.  This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.  He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.  His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.  Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.  



Cath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%.  During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks.  Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR. Pt was started on amio.  Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene.  POBA was done to ostial PDA.  A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.  On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).  He was on amio drip, BB, loaded on plavix, ASA, lipitor, integrilin and was placed on Avandia study.  His complaint of some mild chest pain (not same as anginal pain day before) thought to be from defibrillation.

FOR DETAILS, PLEASE SEE AALIYAH IRAHETA'S NOTE



ID/CC: 49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, Afib, DM, Bipolar, who presents w/ RLE weakness/decreased sensation x 24hrs



HPI: 49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, Afib, DM, Bipolar, who was in USOH until 10d ago, when had weakness in his L arm.  Thought this was 2/2 sleeping on it.  Involved whole arm from shoulder down.  Was still doing his ADL's but felt like the arm was slightly weaker, took 4-5 days to get back to normal.  



Then, 12/12/11, was eating dinner w/ a friend, got up to go to BR, found he had RLE weakness/stiffness.  Noticed it was hard to climb stairs.  Went to sleep    woke up at 2am    nearly fell 2/2 weakness in his leg.  In addition, has sensory loss in RLE, esp foot - felt    cold and dead.     The sensory loss was worst distally, but extended up to his thigh.  Never had trouble speaking or understanding others, did not have a facial droop, no problems w/ his RUE.  Stayed in bed until am, when he called his PCP, who told him to come to ED.  



Of note, in Oct-Nov 2111, had cardiac cath x 2.  Had NSTEMI on Oct 8, 2111    taken to cardiac cath    cath showed significant RCA disease and 40% prox LCx    c/b Vfib needing defib    stent placed for stenotic RCA lesion, c/b dissection needing 2nd stent placed.  Post cath had Afib requiring amiodarone.  Then had subsequent cath Nov 1 after an episode of CP, stents patent, other vessels stable.  After his inpt cardiac hospitalization, was admitted to psych for 1 wk for suicidality/depression.  



Previously, in spring 2110, had L eye visual disturbance    nearly blind    went to GHIC where was dx'ed w/ retinal venous occlusion, treated w/ cortisone and laser surgery, w/ mild improvement in vision (now blurred in that eye).



No HA, no tinnitus, no vertigo.  No blurry vision except in L eye from venous occlusion, no diplopia.  No problems w/ speech.

MRI brain: Acute/subacute infarcts (DWI bright/ADC dark/FLAIR bright) in L cerebellum (punctate) and R precentral gyrus (small elliptical area).  



CT-A head/neck: has aberrant origin of R vert from CCA, both ACA's come off of L carotid, also w/ bilateral fetal PCA's and likely congenitally small vertebrobasilar vessels.  No significant focal stenoses or atheromatous calcifications.  



EKG: pending



MRI L/S spine: negative



IMPRESSION:

49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, DM, Bipolar disorder, afib, s/p recent cardiac cath who presents w/ LUE weakness 10d prior to admission resolving after 4-5 days, and RLE weakness?/sensory deficit? Imaging reveals R precentral gyrus small infarct, L cerebellar infarct, no significant vessel stenoses.  Neuro exam w/ brisker reflexes on R, equivocal RLE weakness, R sensory sx, ? R upgoing toe.  Clinical picture and imaging are not consistent.  Unclear if pt is a poor historian and current sx are non-objective sensory findings and meaningful event was LUE weakness 4-5d ago.

NEURO: stroke w/u including TTE/Holter, lipids/lipoprotein/homocysteine.  

--Will also send hypercoag w/u (including hypercoag panel, PT20210, Factor V Leiden, APLA, lupus anticoagulant) given hx of retinal venous thrombus and young age.

--Will also send BCx2 given recent cardiac cath, although ESR wnl reassuring re ? of endocarditis.

--Will check A1c re ? of adequate DM control.

--Given psych hx, will check tox screen and LFT's.

--Unclear if afib was only in context of post-cath, post Vfib.  Will look for LAE, holter abnl.  Could make a case to anti-coagulate regardless as has had documented afib.  

CV: hold anti-htn meds now.  Continue lipitor at outpt dose.  Allow SBP up to 180.

PSYCH: continue w/ depakote and lithium.  Mood is ok now, but will need to be monitored.

FEN: no IVF, ada 1800 low chol/low fat diet.  

ENDO: NPH 20 bid for now, titrate up as needed, RISS.  Checking A1c.

PPX: put on sc fragmin, nexium.  Pneumoboots.

Russell, Donna
10418061

Ms. Russell comes in for further evaluation.  She has been in Rhode Island for 
six months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She 
does not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is 
associated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  
She does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in 
her chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.

She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has 
hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health 
maintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She 
needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most 
concerned about her chest heaviness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  
Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is 
regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and 
nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise 
within normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We 
sent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with 
nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise 
tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
seconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	Chest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a 
primary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one 
week.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal 
exercise tolerance test.
2.	Hypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.  Continue same 
dose of Synthroid.
3.	Hypertension, well controlled presently.
4.	Hyperlipidemia.  We will recheck this on her next visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell is returning for follow 
up.  She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar 
sensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she 
gets some pressure in her chest.  She gets a slight shortness of 
breath.  It lasts 30 seconds.  She gets as many as three or four 
a day.  The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling 
better and better, as she begins to lose some weight.  I think 
weight loss is going to be critical.  She also is less fatigued 
as she begins to lose weight.

Her hypertension has been under better control.  
Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition 
to the atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.  Weight has gone 
from 200 to 196 pounds.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Pulse is 64.  
Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to 
percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is regularly regular 
with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1.	Hypertension.  Relatively well controlled on 
hydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.
2.	Weight.  Now began to lose some weight and feeling much 
better as a result of it.
3.	Peculiar chest pressure.  I do not think she has coronary 
artery disease given the exercise test.  In light of this, 
we will try to control her blood pressure and get her to 
lose some weight.  Hopefully, this will help with the 
resolution of her symptoms.

Russell, Donna

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.  
She has been doing very well.  She has been exercising and has lost from 
200 to 170 pounds.  She is feeling very well.

Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.  He did not find the 
first ETT acceptable.  The second ETT was grossly positive.  As a result 
of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
nitrate.  She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
pain that she was having before when she went up steps.

She did have hyperlipidemia.  We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
provided some control.  However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
is not an excellent ratio.  Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
limits.

She also has right shoulder lipoma.  This has become apparent since she 
lost so much weight.  She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
recommended Dr. Dawson.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.  Neck is supple.  There 
is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  
Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  
Abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  
Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  None today.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	CAD.  We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.  I also 
gave her nitroglycerine.  We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
continue her atenolol.  She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
Premarin and Synthroid.
2.	Weight loss.  She will continue to exercise.  I suspect she is going 
to lose more weight.  This is excellent.
3.	Coronary artery disease.  Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
cardiac catheterization.  It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.  She is going to 
delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
done on this variety of medical issues.

Reason for consult:  65 year old man with progressive LBP, found to have heterogeneous marrow on MRI, we have been consulted to help evaluate, possibly perform a bone marrow biopsy.



HPI:

65 yo male with PMH significant for DM, autonomic dysfunction, CRI, depression and arthritis who was admitted for progressive lower back pain.  He has had LBP for at least three years which is located in his mid lumbar region, non radiating, worse with standing.  The pain had progressed such that he has a very poor performance status. He cannot stand but for a few minutes at a time.  He denies focal wekness.   He had an MRI of the LS spine 2/02/47 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow.   He has had an SPEP which was normal, he has had a bone scan which was negatvie. He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction. His CRI is longstanding  and attributed to his DM.  He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process, but the pain has been so severe, he was admitted for an inpatient work up.  Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI, perhaps anemia of chronic disease.  He denies any weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, decreased appetite. He does report fatigue which has become progressive.



PMH:

1. DM

2. autonomic dysfunction with orthostatic hypotension

3. diabetic retinopathy

4. depression

5. CRI

FH: Father had Diabetes, mother died of breast cancer.



SH: Worked in Foxworthy Industrials 2100-4 during which time he had multple exposures to chemicals. Retired from working in the city of Victorville 2141. He reports a 30 pyr hx of tobacco, former hx of heavy ETOH use, stopped since 12/46. Denies IV DU.

MRI 1/47: heterogenous bonemarrow uptake in vertebrae and pelvis, concerning for infiltrative process



Imp/Plan:

Mr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature. The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.  He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow. They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process. He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM. We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out. Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.  In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically. Is any of this TB?  Recommend:

-- skeletal survey

-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas

-- beta-2 microglobulin

-- reticulocyte count

-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco

-- guaiac all stools

-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential

-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today. 

-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. Landry in the afternoon.

Thank you for this consult.

RACINE, MAINE				Name:	Quiana Justus

                                                NIHC #:	981-40-48

PROGRESS NOTE					DOB:		







Quiana is a 72-year-old woman who comes in for follow-up of her hypertension.  Please see her current medication list.  She also has a history of diabetes.  



Over the past few weeks to one month she has been having intermittent right shoulder pain.  It is worse with lifting.  The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back.  It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night.  There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness.  The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.



She is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks.  There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees.  She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain.  Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.  



She is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems.  His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30/40.  However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be.  He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do.  We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.  She does get very anxious and upset at times.  She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated.  She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.  



She denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema.  She is on her diabetes medication.  She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.



ON EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress.  Her blood pressure initially was 160/80.  After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180/85.  Neck supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  She has no peripheral edema.

 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)	Hypertension, poor control.  Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.  

(2)	Right shoulder pain.  On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact.  She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.  



(3)	Adult-onset diabetes.  We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.  



She will follow up for her complete physical in May.

NAME:    Justus, Quiana
MRN:       9814048

Quiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who
comes in for a physical.  She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's. 
She can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and
calves.  She has some knee pain with walking, but it is not consistent and does not
occur after short 5-minute distances.  The thigh and calf pain resolve with rest.  She
does not always have back pain with the thigh and calf pain.  She also has occasional
right lateral foot pain that feels like an achy arthritic pain in her foot.  She takes
Vioxx occasionally for that foot pain.  She does not have any dysesthesias or
numbness in her feet or hands.  She has no recent trauma, fevers or chills.  She has
no change in her bowel or bladder.

She has type 2 diabetes.  She has been taking Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.  Her weight is
stable.  She does get annual ophthalmology evaluations.  

She has a history of hypertension. She has not had any chest pain, PND, orthopnea,
dyspnea on exertion or edema.  Her blood pressure is never well controlled when she
comes for her visits here, but her daughter, Iyanna Field, a nurse takes her
blood pressure at home and she reports that it is typically 120/70.  She is currently on
Propranolol LA 160 2 tabs p.o. q.d., Dyazide 1 tab p.o. q.d., Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.

She has a history of hyperlipidemia.  She was intolerant of Lipitor in the past.  She
has been taking the Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. without complications.  She does not do
regular breast self-exams but has not noted any masses.  She is status-post
menopause.  We discussed DEXA bone density scanning, but she did not want to do
it at this time.

We also discussed colon cancer screening.  For now she elects to do stool guaiacs x 3. 
She has not had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or hematochezia, abdominal
pain or weight loss.    

Please see her complete medication update in the LMR. 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married.  She drinks occasional but not excessive alcohol. 
She does not smoke.  There is no history of domestic abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY: Please see family history update in the LMR.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.

She has not had a recent tetanus shot.

PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure here is 150/90.  Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear
without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Her breasts are without masses or adenopathy. 
Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or
murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  She is
moderately obese.  Her rectal exam is without masses.  She has no spinal tenderness
on palpation.  Her lower extremity strength is 5/5.  She does not have any peripheral
edema.  Her distal pulses are 2+.  Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.  This is probably due to her
     spinal stenosis.  However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,
     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  We will check lower extremity noninvasive
     arterial studies to rule out claudication.  She can take the Vioxx p.r.n. for her
     foot pain which I do not think is related.

(2)  Type 2 diabetes.  She needs a hemoglobin A1c.  Her blood pressure ideally
     should be under 130/85.  She reports that it is consistently below that level
     when her daughter checks it.  She needs as chem-7.  She has no evidence for
     neuropathy at this time.

(3)  Health maintenance.  She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today. 
     Will check stool guaiacs x 3.  

We discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention.  She will follow
up in six months and p.r.n.  She has not had a recent tetanus shot. She was given a
tetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.

Dear Dr. Regan: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Percy Root in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Shady Brook Hospital today.  As you know, he is a 70-year-old man who is s/p CABG in May of this year. Today he is doing well folloing his surgery . 



His past medical history is significant for a coronary artery disease, status post IMI,afib,  CABG, PPM,  hypertension, hyperlipidemia, question of an old stroke.  His current medications include aspirin 81 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, lisinorpill 40 mg, Toprol-XL 10 mg, Prilosec 20 mg, Zocor 40 mg, Hydralazine.Coumadin as directed.


Allergies:  No known drug allergies.


He lives in Claxton with his wife, daughter, and grandkids and son-in-law.  He does not drink, smoke or use IV drugs.  He is originally from England.  


Family History:  noncontributory.


On physical examination, his heart rate was 60 and regular,  his blood pressure was 125/70.  Carotids are 2+, good upstrokes, no bruits.  Jugular venous pressure was flat.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Abdomen was benign.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities. Good peripheral pulses.





In summary, this is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery disease,  At this time he is NYHA II. Hre appears a bit volume overloaded. I will add ACE and lasix. Follow up in 1 month.

	Reason for visit:
   72 y.o. admit s/p cardiac catherization revealing patent LAD stent


	Interval History:
   72 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, and CAD. He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8/30/35. A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis. His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR. He was discharged home on 9/02/35 to orbit for future CABG. 
9/03/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain. n 9/04/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities. There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories. EF 55%.  There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex. The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible. 
9/05/35 He was taken to the CCL. mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1. The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion. The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting. The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third. He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a  Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result. This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD. The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis. Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent. The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis. At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection. The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort. He was discharged home on 9/06/35. 

Since his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat. He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea. He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation.  His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF.  He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement  in his level of dyspnea. He was transferred to GCH for a repeat cardiac catheterization. 
Cath today revealing:  Widely patent LAD and LPDA stents. Balloon angioplasty site of proximal D1 patent. Nondominant RCA with 90% proximal lesion Severe cardiomyopathy with mid-distal anterior, apical, and mid-distal inferior hypokinesis. EF 25% with LVEDP 20. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

COLONOSCOPY -  3/31/93 10:00:00 AM

              One sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the

              transverse colon.  The polyp was three mm in size.

              Polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  Resection

              was complete.  Retrieval was not done.

              One sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the

              transverse colon.  The polyp was three mm in size.

              Polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  Resection

              was complete.  Retrieval was complete.

              Hemorrhoids with no bleeding were found.

              A few diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon and in the

              hepatic flexure.

Impression:   1) Single polyp - three mm.  Complete removal was accomplished.

              3) Hemorrhoids.

              4) Diverticulosis.



     COLON (TRANSVERSE), POLYPECTOMY:

         LOCALIZED AREA OF MILD ACUTE INFLAMMATION WITH CRYPTITIS,

         DYSTROPHIC GOBLET CELLS IN CRYPTS, AND RARE METAPLASTIC PANETH

         CELLS.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

76 year old female with three days of painless BRBPR, also reports of black stool, history of PUD.  Source of bleeding not clear.  Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.  Agree no real pain for ischemic colitis, though wbc elevated.  No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.  Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.  Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.  



EGD and colonoscopy this morning

Hold aspirin

Continue QD PPI

If hematocrit drops further, would transfuse 1-2 units to hct of 28-30

Dear Dr.  Morgan:



  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.  She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.  She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes. 



To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus. This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery. There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery. She was then referred to me for further evaluation.



			Past medical history:

   Hypertension. 

Hyperlipidemia. 

Glucose intolerance. 

Left bundle branch block. 

Diverticular bleed. 

Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 

Hypothyroidism. 

COPD.



Current Medications:

 prednisone taper

hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg qd

potassium chloride 10 mEq qd

lisinopril 30 mg qd

aspirin 81 mg qd

calcium supplement 600 mg qd

levothyroxine 25 mcg qd

Lipitor 10 mg qd

Celexa 40 mg qd

albuterol inhaler; Dir: and nebulizer

multivitamins



Allergies:

			

Allergy   She reports receiving Halothane gas remotely with the development of jaundice at the time of her hysterectomy.

Drug allergy   Halothane gas, which caused hepatitis per her report.



			Family history:

   Notable for her father with myocardial infarction at 54.  Mother with ""an enlarged heart,"" who died at 82.



			Social history:

   She quit smoking eight years ago, previously smoked two packs per day for 35 years.  She lives alone but her daughter lives above her in the same building.



			Review of systems:

   She denies any significant change in weight.  She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil.  She reports chronic cough and wheeze, which has been improved on prednisone.  She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain.  No lower extremity edema, palpitations, or dizzy spells.  She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium.  She has no history of stroke, no history of anemia.  She reports her sugars have been diet controlled.  Otherwise extended review of systems was negative.



Physical examination:

			

-Pulse:   70

-BP: 142/70  

-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest

-Skin:   Free of rashes

-Heent:   benign

-Neck:   JVP was at 5.  She had 2+ carotids without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear without significant wheeze

-Cardiac:   Regular, S1 and S2 without murmurs

-Abdomen:   Soft with a nontender reducible ventral hernia

-Extremities:   She had no edema in her extremities with 2+ distal pulses

-Neuro:   She is alert and oriented

-weight:   185 pounds



			EKG:

    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.



			Assessment and plan:

   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past. She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.



Plan: 

1. Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment. 

2. Treatment of her emphysema as per your office. 

3. I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation. 

4. I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.

 Oreilly, Gabrielle  #9868572

Pulmonary Consult by Dr. Trujillo for management of PE

I have seen and examined the patient and agree with the history including HPI, PMHx, Meds, All, Family Hx, ROS; Pexam, labs, studies, assessment and plan as per Dr. Chavez.

Briefly, 78 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8/01 (not surgically repaired) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP, non-productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 89%.  In ED, patient was hemodynamically stable.  CTPE protocol bilateral PE   s in both main PA   s and clot in LLE DV system.  Patient was started on UF heparin.  

PMHx notable for NSTEMI, diffuse CAD, left pleural mass followed by Fidious, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, took coumadin after surgery 30 years ago 

Meds include:  Advair, Lipitor, HCTZ, heparin

Smoked 50 pk-years, quit 8 years ago.

Family hx notable for:  Son passed away in    01 with blood clots.

Pexam:
Sats 94% on 4L, T 98, P 78, BP 186/86 R 20
Gen Comfortable.
O/P Clear
Heart RRR no m/g/r
Lungs decreased BS throughout
Ext:  Superficial varicosities, minimal bilateral edema

Labs notable for:  WBC 15
Trop 0.22
Ntbnp 500

CT scan     multiple large central PE   s and bilateral upper and lower arteries; +emphysema; clot in left popliteal and distal and superficial femoral veins.

ECHO     EF 60%, mod TR RA dilation, RVSP>=54; RV hypokinetic, PFO with R   shunting   (increased RVSP, RA size since last ECHO)

Impression:

Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
Persistent DVT
PFO with right to left shunt
COPD

Recs:

Recommend retrievable IVC filter.  Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
Hypercoag w/u
Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD



Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient,

Yariel Law, M.D.
Wheatland Memorial Nursing Home/Bangdung Office
870 Newburgh Street
Pinehurst, OH  35594

Dear Dr. Law:

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.  His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.  Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.

Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.  The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms.  The P-wave is 5.6 mV.  The R-wave is 31.3 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.

In summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.  His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.  There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.  However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.  Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.  I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.  For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.  I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

EDVISIT^03689964^VALENZUELA, BRIAN^08/09/93^BOYER, DAWN

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

I saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.  Please see his note for

further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and

discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says

yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old

gentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.  He has indwelling

Foley catheter.  He was transported from nursing home to ED as he

has had a fever today to approximately 100.5.  Per EMS, they were

told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased

POs today.  He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.  He

then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more

awake and alert.  He is telling the paramedics that he is at his

baseline.  He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.  No chest

pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers

or chills.  He reports that he is able to discern when he has

abdominal pain.  He has intact sensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.  In addition, CAD, diabetes,

hypertension, CHF.

Please see resident note for list of medication and allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke.  He does not drink.  He is at

a nursing home.  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident note and my HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no

distress.  Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure

102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.  HEENT exam: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck:  Supple.  He has coarse

upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  Heart is regular

rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is slightly distended.  He is

nontender.  He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,

no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower

extremities.  He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.

The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his

urinary tract infection.  His urine and his catheter was cloudy. 

Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the

lab, the patient had his catheter changed.  He then began to no

longer drain urine.  Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on

using ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder. 

Attempts were made to change the catheter, but they were

unsuccessful.  There was pus found at the meatus.  At this point,

the patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology

evaluation.  He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI

and/or abscess.

LABORATORY DATA:  Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,

bicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136.  LFTs

within normal limits.  Normal lipase.  White count of 5.7,

hematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000.  Coags within normal

limits.  UA again is pending at this time.

He will be admitted to the hospital.  I attempted to reach the

patient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the

WBM office, however, my calls went unanswered.  At this point, I

am signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and

urology evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Will be admitted.

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75-year-old S/P L internal capsule stroke 6/32.



Reason for Visit	

Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up. I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time. He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension. He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued. He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology. He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia. His CNIS have no evidence for disease. He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.



Medications	  

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID x 87 days Start Date: 10/1/32 Stop Date: 12/27/32

ATENOLOL	 50MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32

NORVASC (AMLODIPINE)	 2.5MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32



Exam	

Alert, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. 

EOM's full, no nystagmus. 

Face symmetric, full power x 4. No drift. 

Gait steady, narrow-based. 



Plan	

I am pleased with his negative results so far (24 hour holter, CNIS), and I doubt the TTE will change our management. We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule. The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day, and continued treatment for his hypertension, as per Dr. Tolliver. I will see him again in 3 months time, and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions.

Re: Nancy Werner
    MRN 57274347
 
 
Dear Wanda:
 
Nancy Werner is doing better than the last time I saw her in May
in that the triglycerides have decreased to 460, pretty much where
they had usually been.  The LDL is now quite low at 93 but the HDL
has declined to 34.  All in all, the results are compatible with
better glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin 10 mg is
likely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand
discontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL.  The
effect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is
minimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is overrated
except at the high dose of 80 mg.  Even at 80 mg Atorvastatin could
not compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action.
 
Her current medications are Atorvastatin 10 mg, Lopressor 25 mg,
Procardia 60 mg b.i.d., Capoten 50 mg t.i.d., and  Insulin 22 units
A.M.
 
Labs: Cholesterol 220, TG. 460, HDL 34, LDL 93.
 
Blood pressure is 120/80.
 
I restarted the Gemfibrozil, 600 mg b.i.d. and left her on the
Atorvastatin 10 mg.  Although I don't expect any side effects with
this low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I warned Mrs. Werner
and her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or
weakness she should contact us and discontinue medication. 
I think that aggressive therapy is warranted in Mrs. Werner.

Best Wishes.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was examined and 
treated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the history is as 
follows:  The patient is a 47 year old male with end stage renal 
disease on hemodialysis who was referred for abdominal discomfort 
and fever.  His abdominal discomfort had begun within the preceding 
24 hours and had gradually worsened.  He had pain in the left lower 
quadrant radiating to the rectal area.  He did have one diarrheal 
bowel movement.  He specifically denied bleeding. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was awake 
and alert, although somewhat sluggish and apparently uncomfortable. 
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure was 177/90, pulse 117, initial 
temperature 103.3, respiratory rate 20.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal. 
Sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx showed normal architecture. 
NECK:  Supple.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS: 
The breath sounds were essentially clear.  ABDOMEN:  There was mild 
to moderate diffuse tenderness.  No definite mass can be 
appreciated.  Bowel sounds were diminished.  RECTAL:  Stool is 
guaiac-negative, per the resident's examination.  EXTREMITIES: 
Examination of the left thigh showed slight drainage at a recent 
surgical incision site. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes showed sodium 139, potassium 
4.3, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 12, creatinine 2.2, glucose 230. 
White blood cell count was 30,000, hematocrit 38.  Chest x-ray 
showed no definite infiltrate.  Abdominal x-ray showed dilated 
loops of small bowel.  EKG showed no change from previous tracings. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The assessment and plan were 
reviewed with the resident. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  I confirm the provisional diagnosis of abdominal 
pain with question of deep venous thrombosis versus sepsis from as 
yet unidentified source. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The care plan 
was reviewed.  The patient was started on antibiotics and 
ultimately admitted to the hospital for definitive evaluation and 
further care.

	PARK NICOLLET CLINIC
	


	Reason for visit:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up. 


	Interval History:
   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.  He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.  He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.  At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.  He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.  He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.  His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay. 

Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.  He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.  He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.  He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.  A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.  The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.  On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.  A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.  Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.  An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.  HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.

His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit. ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.  He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim. He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.  With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.  His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA. He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder. He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.

Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well. He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.  He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope. He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss. He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.  He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.  The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.  He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.


	Past medical history:
   1. MRSA/VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on 03/13/2117. Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2/19/18. Intraoperatively developed severe RV failure.
2. RV failure. Complication of aortic homograft surgery. TEE on 2/20/18 showed severe RV hypokinesis and severe TR.
3. HIT. Developed HIT post-operatively after aortic homograft replacement in 2/18.
4. Coronary artery disease. Preoperative cardiac catheterization on 03/11/2117 demonstrated 30% focal narrowing in the left main; proximal 30% lesion in the LAD; 50% lesion in D1; mid 50% lesion in the left circumflex, and normal RCA. 
5. Dry gangrene of right 3rd digit of right foot thought to be secondary to an embolic complication of IABP versus HITT.
6. Hypertension. 
7. Hyperlipidemia.

	Assessment and plan:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis. The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.  At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF. HE has evidence of severe TR on exam. From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.  His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection. 

PLAN:
1. PVE endocarditis.  He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement. He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID. We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today. He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively.  We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week.
2. RV failure.  Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion.  We will continue his current dose of lasix.  Dry weight ~175-178 lbs. I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity.  We anticipate some recovery of RV function.  
3. ARF. Resolved. We will check a follow up chem panel today.
4. Right foot gangrene. Involvement of the right 3rd toe with no wet gangrene or signs of infection.  ABI testing in 3/18 showed no PAD.  He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. Werner in vascular surgery.
5. CAD. Non-obstructive disease.  Continue ASA, atenolol and lipitor.  We will hold on ACE-inhibitor given hyperkalemia issues.
6. Hyperkalemia.  Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim.  Ww will check follow up chem panel today.  He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.   

Patient will return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up. Patient seen with Dr. Calhoun.

RE:  Edwin Workman
     #612-48-04-0
 
Dear Dr. Paz:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. 
Overall he is relatively stable from a cardiac standpoint.  Most
importantly, recently he was laid off from his job at Belkin.  He
has been quite depressed about this.  
 
His medical regimen includes Cyclosporin 150 b.i.d., prednisone 6
q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 q.d., Cardura 4 mg. q.d.,
Pravachol 40 mg. q.d., Axid 150 b.i.d., Calcium, vitamin C and D,
Mag. Oxide 250 q.d., Paxil 300 q.d., NPH Insulin.
 
On physical examination he was well appearing in no distress.  He
had a blood pressure of 136/80 with a heart rate of 90, weight was
309 pounds which has increased eight pounds from July.  Chest was
clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP at 30
degrees, non-displaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
Abdomen was soft, nontender. There is no organomegaly, no
hepatojugular reflux. Extremities without edema.
 
Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90. 
Intervals of .16/.08/.33 with an axis of 70 degrees. This is a
normal tracing and unchanged from his previous tracing on 9/20/86.Edwin Workman
#612-48-04-0                  - 2 -          November 09, 2086
 
Therefore, Mr. Workman is stable at this time from a cardiac
perspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
regimen according to his laboratory results.
 
Best regards.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Elmer Knott, M.D.

RE:Fair, Bill

MR#:220-41-86-4

 

Dear Dr. Keys:

 

Dr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome 

right knee.  As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, 

mainly related to sports injuries.

 

He has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  It got so 

bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that. 

 

It has slowly got better since then.  

 

At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with 

activity but he also has rest and night pain.  He has a restricted walking 

distance.

 

With regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and 

requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  He has 

noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.  

 

With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of 

Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to 

have a colonoscopy in the near future.  

 

He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.

 

On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than 

the left.  He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.  

 

He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of 

arthritis.  He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 

degrees.  His varus deformity is not fully correctable.  He has grade 5 

quadriceps power.  

 

X-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete 

obliteration of joint space on the right side.  

 

I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment 

arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.  

 

We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial 

osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement. 

 

At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe 

enough to warrant operative intervention.  We would certainly reconsider 

should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, 

instilling some corticosteroids.  We have advised him that this will only 

provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin 

some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.

 

We have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will 

reassess him.  Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly 

ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the 

knee and instill some corticosteroid.  

 

With kind regards.  

 

Yours sincerely,

Chief Complaint: 

Shortness of breath



History of The Present Illness:  

	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath. He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. 

He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.

	CXR 9/06/62: IMPRESSION: MILD INCREASE IN LINEAR OPACITIES LIKELY SECONDARY TO INTERSTITIAL EDEMA.



Cardiogram

EKG 9/06/62 04:41- 87 BPM, NSR, non-specific T wave abnormalities consisting of inverted T 

waves in aVL (unchanged from previous EKG 12/30/60), no evidence of ischemic changes



Assessment/Plan:

	In summary, Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.



Problem List and Plan:

SOB/Chest tightness:

	--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O

-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema

	-TTE

	-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV

	-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID 

	-d/c Lisinopril

-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat

	-monitor ins and outs, daily weights

	-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin

Renal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of 

+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment 

-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa

-d/c Lisinopril

-dose Neurontin according to renal function

-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis

-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis

Hypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to 

chronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment

	-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID

-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID

-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely

Opioid withdrawal/pain management:

	-Morphine PRN

	-consult pain service

DM:

	-sliding scale insulin

	-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin

Prophylaxis:

	-20mg Nexium PO QD

	-Heparin 5000 units SC BID

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

CAPE CORAL HOSPITAL



Personal data and overall health   The patient is a 53-year-old white male, who presents for followup of multiple medical problems.



Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

Very noncompliant for many years.  Previously had blood sugars as high as 400 to 600 and would not take any medications.  Diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy, which is severe; gastroparesis, which has been severe; recurrent skin abscesses; and probable coronary artery disease.

Hypertension

This has been also severe for many years and noncompliance is a significant issue.  Now complicated also by significant orthostatic hypotension presumably on the basis of autonomic insufficiency.

Coronary artery disease

He is status post recent non Q wave MI with elevated troponins presenting with congestive heart failure and chest pain in the setting of an elevated creatinine.

Chronic renal insufficiency

Creatinine approximately 3.

Pyelonephritis HISTORY OF



Anemia

Chronic.    Extensive workup negative.

Sinus tachycardia

Chronic.  This has been present for many years.  Etiology unclear.  Recent stress test does not show evidence of more complicated arrhythmia.  Cardiac ultrasound was done on his recent admission, and he has an ejection fraction of 63% with no significant valvular disease.  He has symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Migraine headache HISTORY OF



Hepatitis C

Chronic.



Allergies

No known allergies   



Change in therapies and Renewals

senna 2 teaspoons  BID

aspirin 325 mg  qd

hydralazine 25 mg  TID

Imdur 30 mg  QD

Lasix 20 mg  qd

Nexium 20 mg  qd

Norvasc 5 mg  BID

Neurontin 100 mg  TID

labetalol HCl 100 mg  BID

losartan 25 mg  qd

erythromycin 250 mg  TID

Epogen 3000 units sq qwk

Colace 100 mg  BID



Family history   Notable for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.



Social history   He was previously the head statistical programmer for electronic data systems for many years and now disabled.  He is married and has a daughter.  Cigarettes, none times years.  Alcohol, previously heavy.  There was a history of previous illicit drug use.



Review of systems   Since he has been home, he has done reasonably well though he has noted increasing leg edema bilaterally with a significant weight gain.  He denies chest pain or palpitations.  He denies shortness of breath.  He has not been vomiting, and he actually self-discontinued both OxyContin and methadone because he felt that they did not make him feel well.



Physical examination

Pulse   86 per minute

Blood pressure 150/90    Today, 150/90 then 144/86

Weight   185 pounds

Heent   Eyes, ears, nose, and pharynx are normal, but dentition is poor

Neck   No bruits

Nodes   None palpable

Chest   Lungs, clear

Cor   Regular rate and rhythm without murmur

Abdomen   Benign

Extrem   With 3+ massive edema

Neuro   Abnormal gait due to peripheral neuropathy



Assessment and plan   Leg edema is uncertainly due to his vasodilators.  We will discontinue hydralazine and Norvasc.  He has already stopped his OxyContin and methadone.  We will see him back in approximately two weeks to follow up on his blood pressure.  He will have routine laboratory studies done today.

Patient Name: YOUNT, PATRICIA;  MRN: 4711083
Dictated at: 03/08/2088 by BRANDON VICENTE, M.D. 

RENAL CONSULT NOTE 
 
It is a pleasure seeing seeing Ms. Yount in consultation.  She was referred to us by Dr. Michael.  Ms. Yount has a history of diabetes mellitus for the last seven years.  She also has a long history of hypertension.  She retired from IBM in 2085 after working there for many years.  Her last posting was as a electrical mechanic.  She is feeling well.  She denies headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  She also denies shortness of breath or complex partial seizures.  She denies swelling and presence of dysuria, fever, chills.  She is taking her medications regularly.  
 
ALLERGIES 
No known drug allergies.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 
1.  Diabetes mellitus for about seven years.  
2.  Hypertension.  

3.  PVD

4.  Hypercholesterolemia

 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
She denies smoking or drinking.  She has one son living with her.


FAMILY HISTORY 
Positive for diabetes.  
 
MEDICATIONS 
Norvasc 10 mg q. day,

Glucophage 500 mg twice a day,

Glucotrol 5 mg twice a day,

Avandia 4 mg q. day, (she had incresed skin itching with attempts to increase the dose)

Lipitor 10 mg q. day,

Aspirin 325 mg a day (she is not taking aspirin).   


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
Ms. Yount denies any recent visual change, headaches.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, fever, chills.   


PHYSICAL EXAM 
Ms. Yount looks well.  Blood pressure is 148/90.  Body weight is 188.  Repeat blood pressure is 170/80.  On examination of head and neck - no absolutely.  Thyroid is soft, nontender, no nodules.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present.  Extremities - trace edema.  
 
LABORATORY 
Pending.  
 
IMPRESSION 
Ms. Yount has diabetes and hypertension with a mildly elevated creatinine.  Her urine shows presence of protein, which suggests diabetic nephropathy.  Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and  her blood pressure has been well controlled.  However, today the blood pressure is running higher.  I will see her in about two to three months.  If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB.  I also explained to Ms. Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin.

Admission Note

HPI: 73 year old woman with hypertension, DM, peripheral vascular disease presents with dyspnea on exertion for 2 days. Th patient was well and normally active with walking and usual activities without DOE until 2 days ago. Last routine visit was in 9/91 w/ her PCP and was fine. 2 days ago noted DOE when going to store. This persisted w/ activity only. The patient was fine at rest and was able to sleep without difficulty. There were no recent changes in her meds. She had no other symptoms including CP, dizziness, URI symptoms, fever, chills, GI symptoms. No PND, orthopnea.



She previously had a cardiac evaluation during a similar presentation in 2085. She had a low level stress test and echocardiogram. No ischemia was demonstrated at a very minimal exertion. The echo showed LVH and an EF of 61%. Because of an impending snow storm, she decided to come to the hospital for evaluation. In the ED her BP was elevated and her 02 sat was only 78% on RA.



PMH:

1. Diabetes mellitus: on medical regimen, HgA1c 7.3 (9/91).



2. Hypertension: Blood pressure is 140/72.  Echocardiogram 12/85 - EF 61%, LVH. ETT 12/85 - 4 METS, no wall motion abnormalities.

4. Peripheral vascular disease: arterial studies 10/90 - left SFA occlusion, and bilateral distal popliteal/ tibial

vessel disease.  She is well collateralized across the ankles at rest and poorly collateralized across the ankles post exercise.  Perfusion is adequate to the TM level, and poor to the digital level, bilaterally



5. Anemia: normocytic normochromic anemia with a normal SPEP and UPEP and iron studies. Baseline hematocrit of low 30's.

CXR (AP): No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.



CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.  However, evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion. 2. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis. 3. Small right pleural effusion. 4. Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF.



EKG: NSR, LVH, 1st degree AVB, nonspecific ST, TW changes.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea. The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF. The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear. More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI. Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT. Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion. Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process? If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles. Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

Comparison: 6/15/84.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a new right  lower the lobe opacity which appears to the heart border.  This likely represents a right middle lobe pneumonia. There is atherosclerotic calcification of a tortuous aorta.  The heart is enlarged.  The mediastinal flow is unremarkable.  There is stable mild wedge compression deformity and sclerosis of the thoracic spine.



EKG: NSR, nl interval, nl axis, resolved TWI isolated to III



Assessment/Plan: 73yo female with ESRD presents with SB/ cough and RML pna on CXR.

Reason for Visit

Comprehensive evaluation and follow-up of problems.



Problems

      Shortness of breath

11/93 after starting atenolol (and wt gain) devel DOE w/o wheezing. Resolved off it (and w inc lasix 60 --> 80). ETT 12/93 neg to 7 METS, echo 12/93 mild/mod MR, Ao scle w/o sten, LV mild dil 55, LA mod dil,  EF 72%, no RWMA, mod sym LVH, all c/w diastolic dysfunction.

      Lumbar disc disease

4/94 seen for 9 days L buttock--> post thigh pain w/o trauma. No improvement at 2 weeks and MRI done--> mild L4-5 and L5-S1 disc disease, facet DJD and B foraminal encroachment L5-S1. Sx resolved.

      Spell        

4/4/90 at Gym while lying down with his head back, he had dizziness and then weakness.  Seen in Cedars ER with vital signs and sugar fine.  ECG unchanged and not reproducible.  Turns out he's had similar sxs for about 30 years, always with his head back.  TCDs here okay except ? of middle cerebral artery, resolved with spinal CT angio.  

	No further episodes.

      hypertension        

PRESENT SINCE MID 2060'S. HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY DR. TITUS AT DARDANELLE HOSPITAL. 

	ETT 5/12/82 TO 98% PRMHR SHOWED ST CHANGES WHICH WERE SUGGESTIVE BUT NOT DIAGNOSTIC AND THERE WAS BASELINE LVH WITH STRAIN BUT THALLIUM WAS NEG. THERE WERE OCCASIONAL PVC'S AND COUPLETS AND TWO 3 BEAT RUNS OF VT.     HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE ALBEIT ON AN ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HAD EVOLVED. SUBOPTIMAL WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT GAIN 5/23/86. WILL RECHECK 6-8 WEEKS AFTER 8-10 LB WEIGHT LOSS. ETT THAL SCHEDULED, GIVEN ABNL ECG, RISK FACTORS, AND HIS CONTINUING DESIRE TO EXERCISE. 

	5/86 EXCELLENT EXERCISE CAPACITY TO 9 METS, ECG NONDIAGNOSTIC DUE TO BASELINE ABNORMALITIES BUT THALLIUM NL.     

	150/74 7/86 AND WILL ACCEPT THIS FOR NOW BUT STILL NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT. 

	140/78 9/86 WO WEIGHT LOSS. REDISCUSSED IT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SIMPLIFY HIS REGIMEN CONSIDERABLY. HE REMAINS ON VERY ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HE HAD BEEN ON FOR YEARS BY DR. TITUS.   (8/8/87)

[28-Aug-2088]

	REASONABLE CONTROL ON REGIMEN, BUT STILL NEEDS WEIGHT LOSS.  78-9 really not adequate control with his mild diabetes; increased Cardura to 8 mg without help.  Change Procardia XL to Norvasc with increase from 15 to 20 mg.  BP control acceptable. 

	7/91 still a bit suboptimal, and has continued so w wt gain. Lisinopril increased from 40mg qd to bid, lasix from 40 to 60 qd.  7/92 still 140/70. Wt down 5.5 from peak., at 228#  Not improved, so  dec lisinopril to 40 mg and added Irbesartan w good response, though 7/93 suboptimal 140/70 and subsequent ~ 135.  Inc 160-->240 7/94. Following chems. Continue to emphasize weight loss.  

      hyperglycemia

FBS 154 AND HBA1C 6.44 = 129 ON 4/87, DONE BY HPLC METHODS SINCE THERE HAD BEEN A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN BLOOD SUGARS AND HBA1C LEVELS, AND THIS WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH RESULT BY AFFINITY. DISCUSSED DIETARY CHANGE AT LENGTH. 8/87 VISIT.  (8/8/87)  A1C 6.10 = 117.  BLOOD SUGARS BECAME HIGHER, HE DID ACCEPT NUTRITION REFERRAL, BEGUN ON METFORMIN 500 BID WITH GI SXS WHEN 3RD DOSE ADDED.  5/88 A1C 7.04 = 149.  AT THAT POINT HAD LOST 14 POUNDS.  [28-Aug-2088]

HAS HAD VARIOUS ACUTE JOINT SWELLINGS, INCL ELBOW AND ANKLE. APPARENTLY  DX OF GOUT WAS MADE. HE HAS NOTED THIS OCCURS ESPECIALLY IF HE EATS LOTS OF CHOCOLATE, WHICH HE TENDS TO DO FREQUENTLY. LAST EPISODE WAS ABT A YR AGO. NO HO UROLITHIASIS. DISCUSSED POSSIBLE ROLE OF FUROSEMIDE, AND SINCE IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLR TO ME WHY HE NEEDS TO BE ON A HIGH DOSE OF FUROSEMIDE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE ADJUSTED. HOWEVER, NO FURTHER EPISODES.  UNTIL POSTOP 3/86 ATTACK.  HAVE REDUCED FUROSEMIDE.  Spring 2088 HAVING SOME MILD SXS THAT COULD BE PODAGRA AND SOME ANKLE SXS, THOUGH W/O OVERT INFLAMMATION.  WONDER WHETHER LEFT OLECRANON  COULD BE TOPHUS.  HIS RIGHT FOURTH TOE ALSO HAS A LONGSTANDING DEFORMITY WHICH IS NOT TYPICAL FOR TOPHUS BUT COULD BE.  URIC ACID 7.8 1/88. URIC ACID DONE TODAY.  STARTED ON 0.6 COLCHICINE DAILY.  IF URIC ACID HIGH WILL START ON LOW DOSE ALLOPURINOL IN VIEW OF PHOSPHO-TOPHI.  [28-Aug-2088]

Dear Thomas:



  Thank you very much for referring Mr.  Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.  As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.  The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.  After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.  It has been progressive over the last several months.  He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.  He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.  He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.



Past medical history:

   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.  

Hypertension.  

Hypercholesterolemia.  

Hyperhomocysteinemia.  

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  

Gout.  

Renal insufficiency.  

Mild thrombocytopenia.



Current Medications:

  atenolol 25 mg BID

 Coumadin; Dir: as directed

 Ecotrin 325 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 Lasix 120 mg qd

 folate 1 mg qd

 allopurinol 100 mg qd

 Ativan

 Proscar

 free text medications; Dir: Insulin

 Protonix



Allergies:

No known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.



Family history:

   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.  There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.



Social history:

   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.  He does not drink alcohol.  He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.



Review of systems:

   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.  He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.  He denies hematochezia.  He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.  He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He denies dysuria or hematuria.  He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   55 and regular

-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  He does have low dullness in both bases

-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.  He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis



Procedures:

Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.  His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.  Peak blood pressure was 158/80.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.  The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.



EKG:

    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.



Selected recent labs:

 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096. His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again. There are a number of factors involved here. He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled. I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath. He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura. He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO. He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He also has low platelets. The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia. It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation. He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time. Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile. He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well. My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this. He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done. I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization. I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia. Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization. Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

RE:  Vivian Lea Jorgenson

     MR#471-90-84-7

 

Dear Dr. Geiger:

 

Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a

preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071. 

As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease. 

She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and

brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has

increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and

she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September

of this year.  In terms of her cardiac history, she was well

until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath

and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart

failure.  At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which

revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to

shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a

dilated left ventricle.  In addition, she had an echo in June of

2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral

regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. 

She has never been hospitalized since that time for her

congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good

result. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or

claudication.  She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.

In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her

recollection.  She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house

and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is

able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty

from chest 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -2-            August 21, 2071

 

pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops

secondary to fatigue.  

 

Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had

surgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died

of myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

 

Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for

40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous

drugs or cocaine use.  She lives with her husband and briefly

worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.  She

has no known drug allergies. 

 

Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril

50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po

QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily

and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.  

 

On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in

her left arm and 165/70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when

I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7

centimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid

bruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her

heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with

occasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6

systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without

radiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her

extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.  

 

Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.  She has a

diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin

effects.  She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old

anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.  

 

In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease

with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,

likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial

infarction, although she has never undergone heart

catheterization.  She is currently undergoing evaluation for a

thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071

 

Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 

given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden

since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with

imaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only

fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she

will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative

myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is

well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having

surgery.  

 

Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection

fraction.  She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection

fraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation

and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or

rhythm.  Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days

prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after

surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons

as to how may days she should wait after surgery before

restarting that medication.  She will otherwise remain on her

current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and

primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.  If her stress test

is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for

further evaluation.  

 

Thank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen

and examined with Dr. Voss. 

 

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Van:

I had the pleasure of participating in the care of VivianLee Jorgenson during her recent hospitalization at Goulds Hospital.  This lovely 67-year-old female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization.  At the time of the cath, her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 12.  During the course of her hospitalization, we noted as well that she had had runs of nonsustained VT and asked our EP colleagues to comment on the appropriateness of an ICD.  They felt that this could certainly be rediscussed in the future, but at the present time, there was no compelling indication for her to receive an ICD.

Her medications at discharge include Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d., Synthroid 300 mcg p.o. q.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.

It has been a delight to participate in the care of this lovely woman.  If there is any questions or issues, please feel free to call.

Sincerely,

                                                       Patient Name: JARVIS,AMADOR [ MRN: 0907307PCC ]

                                                         Date of Visit: 05/11/2089





REASON FOR VISIT:  Mr. Jarvis comes for a regular 6-month followup 
visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has been feeling extremely well without 
any illness or any unpleasant symptoms.  He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring.  He and his wife are 
planning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly 
long weekends in New Mexico.

He has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema.  The pains in his hips 
and legs have not been bothering him.  When he tests his blood glucose level, he 
gets results that range between 170 and 120.  He has not been specifically 
exercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores 
and walk the intervening distance.  He continues on 1/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg 
per day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day.  Otherwise, the review of systems is 
unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks cheerful and fit.  Blood pressure in the 
right arm, sitting 140/86 with regular pulse 64.  Chest is clear to P&A.  Heart 
sounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm.  Neck 
veins are not distended.  Abdomen is nontender.  Extremities have good dorsalis 
pedis pulses.  Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.

IMPRESSION:  Very stable with regards to hypertension.  He remains 
moderately hyperglycemic.  He has an appointment to be followed by the 
urologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic-
specific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia   
considered only a risk factor).

PLAN:  We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when 
the results are available.  He should return in 6 months.

Mr Jarvis: The glucose when you were here was 244 and the average calclated from the HbA1c is 171; despite your efforts and exercise and diet.  I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose-lowering medicine, glipizide (Glucotrol).  I would start on 1/2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time.  If they stay a bit up, then increase to one whole pill (5 mg) twice a day.  Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar.  I don't think this will interfere with your trip.  Call me in a week to tell me how it is going.



Best wishes,

CV:

-Echo 11/91:  bioprosthetic prosthetic valve in the mitral position. The valve appears well-seated.  The left atrium is dilated. There is restricted aortic leaflet opening c/w valvular aortic stenosis.  The peak trans AV gradient is 46 mmHg.  The mean trans AV gradient is 23 mmHg. The aortic valve area is 0.8 sqcm., calculated by the  continuity equation. (LVOT dimension=1.8 cm.)  (LVOT velocity=1.06 m/s.)  The peak velocity was obtained from the apical 5 chamber view.  There is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency.  The left ventricular cavity size is small.  The left  ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.  There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  The estimated ejection fraction is 55 %.

Impr/Plan:  75 yo woman with MVR, HOCM, severe AS who p/w following episode of syncope.



1. Syncope: hx worrisome for cardiac etiology given suddenness of the episode w/o much warning.  Likely etiologies could be some decreased pre-load in setting of recent increased diuresis, perhaps decreased po intake in a woman dependent on preload 2/2 her valvular disease.   In addion, pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate interrogating her pacer.  Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well.

--will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease, LV function, could consider stress test

--will consult EP to assess pacer function

--pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight

--will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent 

--will re-check carotid studies

--will re-start ASA (it was recently stopped) given carotid and vascular disease



2. CHF: pt carries diagnosis of CHF and CXR c/w some pulmonary congestion.  On exam, pt with crackles bilaterally also c/w pulm edema.

--will cont outpt lasix but need to be very careful given pt's tenous volume status



3. COPD: cont outpt regimen



4. FEN: normal diet, replete lytes as needed



5. proph: boots, TEDS since pt HIT positive, nexium

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

60 year old woman presents with a history of watery diarrhea, gas and diffuse abdominal pain for the past two weeks that has increased in intensity in the last 3 days.  For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.  No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.  Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.  Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.  Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.  Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.



1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.  This history is suggestive of overflow diarrhea.  Patient denies recent narcotic usage and no obstructing lesions are seen on CT scan.  May also be infection, malabsorption, osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or a motility defect.  No evidence is seen for ischemia, inflammation or infection.  Bowel dysmotility resulting from DM may play a role in a motility disorder.

 - Diet: clears now, NPO after midnight

 - Stool for fecal leukocytes, O&P, C. diff

 - Bowel regimen:  colace, senokot, miralax

 - Reglan PRN nausea

- Follow clinical exam

 - Follow WBC, T, lactate for signs of acute sepsis or ischemia

 - Appreciate GI input (Dr. Utterback)

 - Apprecate surgery input (Dr. Espinosa)

 - Ranitidine prophylaxis, zofran PRN nausea



2) Gyn:  Patient is s/p breast cancer and has fibroids.  No evidence of abdominal mass other than fibroids.

 - Continue on tamoxifen 20 mg PO QAM



3) Psychiatric:  Depression & anxiety

 - Buspar

 - clonazepam

 - effexor



4) DM2:  Continue home meds (metformin + insulin), hold when on diet without substantial calories (clears, NPO)



5) Prophylaxis:  patient is ambulatory; ranitidine; commode by bedside.

(060) 107-3378                     04/16/2076




HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman who returns after recent acute coronary syndrome experience and for follow up of other medical problems.


PROBLEMS:
1.  Acute coronary syndrome.  She was in New York and experienced chest pain.  She was seen at Conway Hospital where she underwent placement of two stents in the right coronary artery.  EKG changes suggest IMI.  She was told that she would need further intervention, but comes with no paperwork.  She has had no further chest pain.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.  A1c one month ago was 6.7.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.  Please see prior notes for full lipid analysis, but LDL was 221.  She has been on Zocor.
4.  Mitral valve disease.  Prior to recent coronary event, she underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a mildly thickened and calcific aortic valve with a slight gradient.  There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus and leaflet as well as the subvalvular apparatus with an echo dense mobile structure and trigger aspect suggesting a partially disrupted chordae.


MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily.
4.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly though given a prescription for Lipitor 80 mg nightly in New York.
5.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily.
6.  Metformin 500 mg daily.
7.  Norvasc 10 mg daily.
8.  Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg p.r.n.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Blood pressure 120/88, weight 213 pounds, and temperature 97.8.  Chest clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam; no extra sounds. Rather coarse near holosystolic murmur. No apprecialble 2nd or third compenents. No pedal edema.


EKG today:  Heart rate was 54 and regular with normal intervals.  She has a Q-wave in III and F and slight reversal of R-wave progression in right precordium.  These are distinct change from EKG done one month ago.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Status post IMI.  Not on beta-blocker and I will not initiate given sinus bradycardia.  I have arranged for her to be seen in Cardiology to determine best next steps.  I tried to contact the cardiologist who took care of her in Conway Hospital whose phone number is 674-449-3338.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.  Good control.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.  Will initiate therapy with Lipitor 80 mg p.o. nightly for this and problem 1 above.  Prior authorization form completed.
4.  Mitral valve disease.

Date:  May 20, 2094



70-year-old female, first visit to MSH AMED. 



MEDICATIONS:  Ibuprofen 800 mg 1 p.o. b.i.d., has taken for years. Self-d/c'd meclizine, unclear status on H2 blocker.



ALLERGIES: Percocet, codeine, sulfa.



PMH: Includes fibromyalgia with chronic pain, osteoarthritis, recurrent vertigo, cervical spondylosis, lumbar spondylosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, myofascial pain, dizziness, syncope, chest pain of unclear etiology, sinusitis, DJD. Status post laminectomy 2062. 



S:	70-year-old female accompanied by daughter, Qazi, here to initiate primary care closer to home. Previously followed by Dr. Faust, but daughter needs closer PCP. In addition, patient followed in arthritis clinic by Dr. Solomon and has received injections per patient report from severe muscle spasms of both arms. Also seen by pain clinic. Main issue is continued lower back pain and primary care. Of concern is patient reveals an unclear history of chest pain which was thought to be arthritis, but is accompanied by episodes of syncope, witnessed in a grocery store. Patient has not had to her knowledge a cardiac workup for this. Also had some vascular studies done at that time and was told they were normal. The patient is unclear on status of recent pelvic exam. GYN - G7, P7, still with uterus but not sexually active. Denies any change in bowels. Denies any change in appetite. 



The patient has been complaining of animals crawling across her chest. States she used a cream for 1 week with resolution but now feels the animals are back, and she has been using a pesticide agent which sounds like a Kwell agent to resolve these. 



Recent testing - L-spine films confirm grade 2 anterospondylolisthesis L4-L5 with disc space changes at L1-L2. Negative allergy testing. 1/1 immune globulin testing significant for an IgG of 15/40 and positive ANA at 1:40 and 1:60. MRI of spine 12/93 shows degenerative changes of lumbar spine. No evidence of disc herniation or canal stenosis. 11/92 - Paranasal sinus films show no evidence of sinusitis. Mammo 3/94 WNL. Carotid ultrasound done 12/93 shows minimal disease of right and left carotid bifurcations. TCDs 12/93 suggest a stenosis of the left vertebral artery with an RVA WNL. Velocity suggests a mild stenosis. EKG 12/93 shows sinus brad with an LAE. No other significant changes. Nonspecific ST changes. 



O:	HEENT - Unremarkable. Skin - No obvious sign of rash or infection where she states the animals are present. CV - BP is 170/88. RR at 60. No murmurs, gallops, rubs present. Lungs - Clear to P&A. B12 was 331. Attempted Pap smear. External genitalia unremarkable. Vaginal introitus is very small. Patient got very cold and clammy and nervous throughout the tried Pap smear; so Pap smear attempt was terminated at that time. Consent was obtained to conduct Pap smear. Lungs - Clear to P&A. 



A/P:	(1)	Dizziness of unclear etiology. Neuro consult had been done when the patient was hospitalized, and meclizine has not been of any benefit. Will refer patient to Vascular to ascertain whether the TCD findings are related. 



(2)	Report of syncope. Will obtain stress test.



(3)	Chronic NSAID usage. Add ranitidine HCL 150 mg to 1 p.o. q.h.s. to regime. Patient will follow up with Dr. Helen Whitehead as  her new PCP.

Xanders, Ruth

MR #564-19-92-7

December 16, 2081

 

Ms. Xanders is a 42-year-old woman with multiple medical problems who

presents for evaluation of chronic hepatitis C.  She reports having

had a blood transfusion in 2059 and has had no history of other

percutaneous exposure including intravenous drug use.  She has had

normal transaminases in the past but a positive hepatitis C

antibody test.  She reports no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting,

anorexia or weight loss, no diarrhea, constipation, melena or

bright red blood per rectum.  She has had no fevers, chills,

sweats, arthralgias, myalgias or skin rash, epistaxis, easy

bruising or bleeding gums and she has no insomnia or episodes of

confusion.  She reports a generally good energy level with some

mild fatigue.  

 

Past Medical History:

     1.  Hypertension.

     2.  Diabetes.

     3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

     4.  Hyperlipidemia.

 

Current Medications:  Humulin NPH 20 units qAM, 15 qPM, Humulin

Regular insulin 3 units qAM, 5 qPM, Lipitor 40 mg po q.h.s.,

Procrit 3,000 units sub q. bi week, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Quinine

260 mg po q.h.s. and Hyzaar 100/25 mg po q. day as well as Naftin

prn.

 

Allergies:  Lisinopril causes cough.

 

Family History:  No history of liver disease or GI malignancies.  

Social History:  She continues to smoke but has cut back recently

and she drinks alcohol approximately once a week to once every two

weeks.  

 

Review of systems otherwise negative for HEENT, cardiovascular,

respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal or neurological systems.

 

On exam, she is a well-appearing woman in no acute distress.  Pulse

80 and regular, blood pressure 152/76, weight 151 pounds.  HEENT

she is anicteric with equal, round, reactive pupils and normal

conjunctivae.  Oropharynx reveals no ulcers or icterus.  Neck

reveals no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest is clear to

auscultation and percussion.  Heart reveals a regular rate and

rhythm, S1 and S2 are present without murmur, rub or gallop.  

Xanders, Ruth

MR #564-19-92-7               -2-            December 16, 2081

 

Abdomen is soft, nontender and non-distended with no

hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremities reveal no clubbing,

cyanosis or edema.  

 

Most recent labs from October 22, 2081 reveal an ALT of 13, AST 19,

alkaline phosphatase 78, bilirubin 0.3, creatinine 3.1, albumin

3.6.  

 

Impression:  Ms. Xanders has a history of a positive hepatitis C

antibody with normal LFT's.  Today, we will check a hepatitis C RNA

level to see if she is in fact viremic or whether she is one of the

lucky 15% of people who clear the virus but remain antibody

positive.  If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than

she requires no further workup.  However, if she is RNA positive

than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of

inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for

treatment with interferon/ribavirin.  She is amenable to this and

we will follow-up in two weeks by phone to discuss the results of

her RNA test.

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on 10/28/2078. He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning. 

His episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.


	Past medical history:
   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 
2) Palpitations 
3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	

	Allergies:
	
No known drug allergy


	Medications (Confirmed):

	
aspirin  81 mg po daily
penicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day


	Family history:
   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. 


	Social history:
   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.

Habits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.


	Review of systems:
   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

Physical examination:
	
-BP: 110/70  
-Pulse: 59  BPM regular
-resp. rate: 16  unlabored
-Skin:   without lesions or nodules.
-HEENT:   EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Mucous membranes moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
-Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.
-Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion.
-Cardiac:   regular with a normal S1/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
-Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses.
-Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
-Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.


	EKG:
   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.


	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. 

We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. 

I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. 

Yours truly, 

Norman C. Ivers, M.D.

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of rapid heart action. At his last visit we gave him a 30-day loop event recorder for arrhythmia surveillance due to palpitations. Since that point he has transmitted events showing rapid atrial fibrillation up to 160 Bpm associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping. These episodes occur on a random basis and last up to 45 minutes. He does not identify any precipitating factors and symptoms resolve spontaneously. He denies dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, lightheadedness, pre syncope or syncope. He reportedly has had a negative stress test and echocardiogram. He is not on any medications. He has never been on Coumadin. 


	Past medical history:
   1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation

	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation. We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. 

We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment. We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily. If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation. We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management. He has a CHAD2 Score of 0. We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time. 

We will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed. We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns, or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

Roger Easterling, M.D. 
27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of atrial fibrillation to discuss findings on recent SESTA MIBI. As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation. Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. He is on Toprol XL 50 mg and aspirin. SESTA MIBI completed January 5, 2079 after 11 minutes, 13 METS and 90 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II, AVF, and V6 and 2.5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V5. Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 66%. He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs. Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 40 mm. 

Since his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action, jaw pain and chest discomfort. The episodes lasted approximately 10 minutes and were relieved by rest. He denied lightheadedness, dizziness, pre syncope, syncope, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note they occurred this time with exercise as opposed to at rest and they seemed more severe in nature. 




	Past medical history:
   1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 
2. Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatitis 
3. Palpitations 
4. Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	

	Changes to Allergies
	
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]


	Medications (Confirmed):

	
aspirin  81 mg po daily


	Family history:
   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. 


	Social history:
   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine. 

Habits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.


	Review of systems:
   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI. We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention. We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death. He understands and has agreed to proceed. We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation. He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation. We have had a long discussion in this regard. We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly. His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.  Sotalol is the best option at this time. 

We have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079. If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load. We will assess after his angiogram. We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis. 

We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

Seen with Dr. Person.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, REVIEW OF 

SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES:  Were reviewed and confirmed.  

Please see Resident note for further details.  

HISTORY:  I interviewed and examined the patient myself.  The 

history briefly is as follows.  This is a 51 year-old male who was 

recently discharged from the hospital here after a successful 

percutaneous lithotripsy and nephrostomy placement.  He presented 

this evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he 

believes may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he 

was sitting on the sofa and got up.  He has been leaking 

serosanguineous fluid since earlier today.  He has no fever, 

chills.  No other complaints.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes diabetes, hypertension, CAD, high 

cholesterol.  

MEDICATIONS:  He takes hydrochlorothiazide, Zestril, Calan, Zocor 

and Levaquin.   

ALLERGIES:  He has no allergies to medications.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his family.  

FAMILY HISTORY:  He has no significant family history.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.2, heart rate 93, 

blood pressure 136/81.  He is an awake and alert male in no acute 

distress.  HEENT - Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  

Neck is supple.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  

Cardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub 

or gallop.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Mildly obese.  Skin is 

warm and dry.  Left flank is with some resolving ecchymosis.  No 

obvious subcutaneous fluid, and the area around the nephrostomy 

drain is intact.  His gurney linens are soaked with serosanguineous 

fluid.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  

Neurologically alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  No motor or sensory deficits.   

CONSULTATIONS:  He is seen in consultation by the Urology Service 

and his tubing was cut back and cap replaced.  It is unclear as 

this was placed by Radiology exactly the exact 

configuration of the tubing.  However, it appears to have ceased 

leak at this time.  

DISPOSITION:  He is discharged in satisfactory condition with 

instructions to return for return of symptoms or for any other 

concerns, and to call to have follow up arranged for early next 

week.

Uecker, Vastie

MR# 3038560

Date of Admission: 3/30/36

Attending: Dr. Zehr

Admitting Resident: Patricia Nunn

Source of history:  records and pt



ID/CC:	62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/NSTEMI and DVTs.



HPI: Pt at baseline occasionally gets SOB from her bronchiectasis if she has not had chest PT recently but otherwise is able to walk up multiple flights of stairs without SOB.  She has no known cardiac hx but does have HTN and + fam hx of early CAD.  Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  Pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  She then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  Her husband gave her Excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w/o effect.  The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, Colorow.  In the ED, she was found to be hypertensive w/ SBP 180s, for which she was started on TNG gtt.  She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs, and she was started on heparin.  She was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her CP w/ relief.  She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N/V.  Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ CK/MB/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop I 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  EKGs showed right-bundle morphology (though QRS not wide) w/ initial TWI V1-V3 which progressed to deepening TWI V1-V4 and some downsloping STD V3-V4.  Pt is currently chest pain free, no SOB, no palpitations.  She denies any preceding viral illness or any surprises or acute stressors in her life, though she has many chronic medical problems.

PE CT (reviewed w/ ED rads here): no PE to the level of subsegmental arteries, no dissection, no pericardial effusion or bowing of interventricular septum to suggest RV strain, lung parenchyma w/ scattered nodules, largest 6.5 mm, bilat fem veins w/ filling defects



EKG:  NSR 78 bpm, IVCD w/ right-bundle morphology unchanged w/ TWI V1-V2, flat Ts I, avL, 1 mm downsloping STD V3, < 1 mm horizontal STD V4



TTE: prelim read RV and LV function wnl, no segmental WMA



Impression:   62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/ NSTEMI and DVTs, now chest pain free.  Possible etiologies for her chest pain w/ + cardiac markers include ACS, PE, myopericarditis, spasm, or apical ballooning syndrome.  Dissection less likely w/ equal pulses and not seen on PE CT.  Her EKG changes suggest an element of RV strain, though this is not borne out on TTE, and review of her OSH CT w/ radiology here did not reveal PEs (at least to the level of subsegmental arteries).  Her TTE did not show WMA, and her story could be c/w ACS or c/w myopericarditis or apical ballooning syndrome (esp w/ hx of fibromyalgia, raynaud   s, migraines, etc), though w/ + cardiac enzymes and dynamic EKG changes, need to have low threshold to cath if develops pain.

Established patient: Sick visit.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shoulder pain.  

She presents with approximately one week of acute onset of 
left shoulder and neck pain without trauma.  She has limited 
abduction and adduction of the left shoulder.  She has pain 
at the AC joint.  There is bony deformity from arthritis of 
the shoulder.  She has no swelling and no heat on this 
joint.  Sensorimotor and DTRs are intact.  Light touch is 
intact to sensation.  Vascular is intact.  No paracervical 
muscle pain in the neck, and pain with adduction, flexion, 
extension, and rotation in the neck.  

ASSESSMENT: Neck and shoulder pain, which is atraumatic.  ? 
of osteoarthritis with flare v. inflammatory arthritis v. 
cervical spine stenosis.

PLAN: X-rays of the neck and shoulder, ibuprofen 800mg 
t.i.d. with food, Percocet one to two q.4-6h p.r.n. pain, 
Neurontin 200mg b.i.d., heat to the shoulder, and follow up 
with Dr. Gonzalez of Orthopedics for evaluation.

Admision note:

please see my note of 7/01/95 discharge below. 

CC chest wall pain with EKG changes at interventional radiology.



She is an 81 yo woman with a h/o diverticulitis and diverticular abcess treated with a percutaneous drain and has developed a colocutaneous fistula. 
She is at the McDonough County Rehabilitation. She had her drain in the LLQ changed 7 days ago and devoloped some leaking from the drain in the past couple of days.
She was scheduled to come in to the Radiology department to change the drain.  She developed chest pain in the IR suite associated with increased BP and HR to 130 with deep ST changes in the anterolateral and inferior changes
and new RBBB .  The chest pain was relieved with SL NTG and was taken
to ER for eval. Since being in the ER, her symptoms have abated and EKG changes have improved to baseline.  Troponin/CPK are negative at baseline.

PMHx: see below

     PROCEDURES: Surgical consultation with Dr. Yonathan Orth; interventional
     radiation radiology consultation; adenosine sestamibi stress test;
     pulmonary embolus CT of the chest; abdominal CT scan.
     
     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman who is a
     Broadcasting and Performing Arts Manager who had been in the McDonough County Nursing Home until the day
     of admission when she woke up with right-sided and epigastric chest
     discomfort associated with shortness of breath that was associated with a
     feeling of warmth rising from her upper abdomen up to her face.  She
     described no radiation discomfort to her left arm, no diaphoresis.  She has
     had these episodes in the past.  She was noted to be hypertensive at the
     McDonough County Nursing Home, up to 200/130, and was given metoprolol 50 mg and
     multiple sublingual nitroglycerins.  She was sent to Pan American Hospital
     for further evaluation. In the emergency room, she received 3
     nitroglycerins, Tylenol and morphine which helped relieved her pain.
     
     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above, plus ischemic colitis. In
     addition, she is debilitated and has lost a significant amount of weight,
     approximately 40 to 50 pounds since January.  She also has asymptomatic
     gallstones.
     
     MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg daily, Epogen 400 units subcu 3
     times a week, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime, megestrol acetate 200 mg daily
     until 07/15/2095, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation, zinc 1 p.o.
     daily, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, metoprolol 50
     mg b.i.d., methadone 5 mg b.i.d., isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d., ferrous sulfate
     325 mg p.o., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, lactulose p.r.n. constipation,
     Dulcolax p.r.n. constipation, oxycodone 5 mg q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain.
     
     ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
     
     PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighed 88.7 pounds, pulse 68 and regular,
     respiratory rate 20 and unlabored, room-air oxygen saturation was 97%,
     blood pressure was 160/90.  General appearance: Cachectic, elderly woman
     who was in no acute distress.  HEENT: Mucous membranes were dry, pinpoint
     pupils that were minimally reactive, extraocular motions were intact,
     oropharynx without erythema.  JVP 4 cm supine.  There was no
     lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2.
     There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Chest:
     Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left
     lower quadrant without external drainage.  The abdomen was soft with mild
     tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or
     guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout.  Extremities reveal no
     edema.  There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis
     on the left side of her foot.  Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
     
     Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral
     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength
     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior
     tibialis.
     
     LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets
     443,000.  INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were
     negative x3.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.
     Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  Her
     adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible
     perfusion defects.  She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior
     heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%.  CT of chest with a PE
     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
     
     HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
     of general surgery.  The patient had expressed an interest in considering
     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
     Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during
     surgery.  After extensive
     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,
     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may
     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
     to pursue this.
     
     Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
     Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.  She will
     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.  Her chest wall pain is
     likely due to esophageal spasm.
     
     Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
     
     Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
     fibromyalgia.  This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications. At the time, we
     will continue pain medications for her comfort.  Continue aggressive bowel
     regimen.
     
     Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.  The family currently
     working to try to obtain dentures for her.
     
     Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive
     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic
     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.
     
     DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
     p.r.n., vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, Colace 100
     mg b.i.d., Epogen 4000 units 3 times a week, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.
     daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily,
     milk of magnesia daily p.r.n. constipation, megestrol acetate suspension
     200 mg p.o. daily to terminate on 07/15/2095, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
     mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. at bedtime, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, oxycodone
     p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, Zocor 20 mg p.o. daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o.
     daily, methadone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
     
     DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred back to the McDonough County Rehabilitation Center.

Re:  	Horn, Gregory

      	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up.  



VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.  



Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous. For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.



The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.



He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.



He has managed to lose 6 lbs. by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.  



GE reflux is very well controlled.



Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.



On Examination:  He is well appearing. Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.  Oropharynx is clear.  Conjunctivae are clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.  Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis. 



Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.



Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.



Weight is 238 lbs. (BMI 38).



Impression:



1.	Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.  I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.  I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.  



I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.  If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.  The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.  I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs. to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.  Hence, he has his work cut out for him.



2.	Obesity - As above.



3.	Diabetes.



4.	Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.



5.	GE reflux - As mentioned.



6.	Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.



Recommendations:



1.	Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.



2.	Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. - as 20 mg b.i.d. did not give full control with the generic pills.



3.	We will review pathology.



4.	Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.



5.	I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.  



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.  



Sincerely,

HPI:   	[Per patient, chart]

85F hx CHF, COPD, DM2, HTN, PVD (s/p mult procedures) p/w acute sob this AM. Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to WGH Pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on Tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On Friday AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in WGH ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to WGH, told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on Friday 12/09/88, pt went into WGH Pecos clinic. Per Pecos note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II/III/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to WGH ED.



ED Course: On arrival to WGH ED, pt had VS T 98.2, P 74, BP 160/70, RR 24, O2 Sat 95% RA. Pt's EKG was read as showing ST depressions in V4-V6. Pt received NTG sl x 1, lopressor IV 5 mg x1, lopressor 25 mg po x1, and reportedly EKG changes improved w rate control. CXR in ED was clear. BNP was in 1400s (vs 6000-12000 during prior WGH admissions where CHF was diagnosed).

___________________________________________

Impression:

85F w hx CHF, CAD, COPD in w exertional sob that started on AM of admission. Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI. While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.  CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.  If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent. However, ST changes appear minimal on close evaluation of EKG changes. Cardiac enzymes are negative so far.



Plan: 

1.	SOB

a.	Cont to cycle cardiac enzymes. Negative so far.

b.	Cont tele

c.	Atrovent and albuterol nebs

d.	Cont home lasix dose for now. Does not appear to be volume overloaded.

e.	Pt has not received stress test which was recommended after most recent WGH admission. Would pursue this now to help sort out whether ? EKG changes are real and indicative of significant ischemic disease. At current level of dyspnea, pt would not be able to do a treadmill test.

f.	PT/OT consults.

2.	UTI

a.	Repeat UCx

b.	Per pt and chart, multiple allergies, though pt is unclear on specific reactions. Will start tetracycline po based on urine culture data from 12/03/88.

3.	DM2

a.	Cont glipizide

b.	Check bid fingersticks

c.	RISS

4.	FEN

a.	Cardiac, low salt, diabetic diet.

5.	Prophylaxis

a.	Cont home PPI. 

6.	Code Status

a.	Per notes from 2088, full code. Will d/w pt, PCP, family.

NAME:    Vines, Stephen

MRN:     1672569



Mr. Vines comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well though he is

distressed at his 18-pound weight gain.  His sugars were in the 300s before starting

the insulin.  Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.  His

fasting sugars have been in the 120s.  His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s. 

He had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a

month.  Other than that, he really has no new complaints.  He is still not smoking. 

He is still on the patch.  His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he

can stop the Neurontin now.  He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or

edema.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.  No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no

new skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints. 



HABITS: Not smoking or drinking.  Not getting much exercise now.



PHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right. 

His pulse is 76 and regular.  Respirations are 16.  Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular

rate and rhythm, negative M/R/G.  No bruits heard.  Nasopharynx unremarkable. 

Abdomen is benign.  He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet. 

The cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.  He has some neuropathy of

the feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to

monofilament is intact on both feet. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.  It may still be a little bit

     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.  I

     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the

     afternoon.  If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning

     insulin to 35 units.  He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his

     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.  He had an eye exam earlier

     this year with Dr. Yousif.



(2)  Hypertension.  Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.



(3)  Hyperlipidemia.  Recheck lipids and SGOT today.



(4)  CAD prevention.  He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.



(5)  Status-post splenectomy.  He needs a Pneumovax booster 0.5 cc was given in

     the left deltoid.

HPI:  Patient is a 59-year old who has a history or active issues 
significant for hypertension first diagnosed on visit of 10-74.  She is 
currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO 
q.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d.  Patient comes in 
today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine 
baseline examinations.  On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, 
and on check today it was 150/90.  We discussed the possibility that she 
continue her salt-restricted diet.  We also discussed that she continue 
her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.  She currently 
weighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4'9"" tall.  
 
As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.  However, at 
this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
200s-190s.
 
 
Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
now appears to be much more stable.  She is currently living with her 
mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no 
murmurs.  Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
tenderness.  She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
swelling bilaterally at the ankles.   Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
or lumps.
 
She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
guaiacs.  Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
issue at this point.

HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
checkup. Patient appears to be doing fine. She has been compliant with her 
antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also 
hydrochlorothiazide. Since our last meeting, the patient has lost 
approximately 15 to 20 pounds. She has been exercising on a daily basis 
and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and 
beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
was 120/80 in both arms. The patient was complaining of some ankle 
swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been 
on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent 
admission. I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which 
I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her 
symptoms over the next few days. 
 
The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had 
chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065. We 
have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed 
rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises. The 
patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for 
services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain. 
Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming. 
Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
 
ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient 
agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have 
either a mammogram or a Pap smear. She complains that she does not have 
faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used 
to and does not want to have done. I attempted to discuss the need and why 
it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do 
this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly 
refuses either of the two examinations.

WESTYN-NUEL,KELLI   898-97-85-6            VISIT DATE: 02/13/79
This patient was seen with Dr. Quilla Uehara, an Emergency 
Medicine resident.  The PRESENTING COMPLAINT, HISTORY OF PRESENTING 
COMPLAINT, PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL 
HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, and REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted on the 
record by Dr. Uehara, and as reviewed with the patient and with Dr. 
Uehara.  Briefly, the patient is a pleasant 64-year-old woman, who 
has had episodes of severe left-sided pressure-like chest pain off 
and on through the course of this week.  This has occurred with 
exertion and has always cleared with rest.  She is pain-free at 
present, but presents to the Emergency Department because she 
reported to her family that she had ceased taking her high blood 
pressure medications. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The physical examination is as noted by Dr. 
Uehara.  Basically, the examination is completely normal with the 
exception of the blood pressure, which ranges from 220 to 230 over 
100 to 110.  The patient's electrocardiogram does not show acute 
changes. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The cardiac troponin I is 0.53. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  I concur with Dr. Uehara that the 
patient has a strong history for unstable angina.  The patient will 
be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.  She has 
remained pain-free while in the Emergency Department and has 
received nitroglycerin paste.  Her blood pressure will be treated 
with initiation of an ACE inhibitor. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

Westyn-Nuel, Kelli
#898-97-85-6
July 20, 2079
 
Ms. Westyn-Nuel returns following myocardial infarction with
stenting procedure in February of this year. She continues to do
well and had an LDL of 90 in March. We will recheck it again today. 
She has no significant chest discomfort and is doing all of her
activities.  She has no syncope or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She is tolerating her medications quite well and is happy with her
progress.  At home she takes her blood pressure and it's generally 
around 120/80.
 
Current medications are one aspirin per day as well as Isordil 20
mg. t.i.d., Labetalol 400 mg. t.i.d., Norvasc 7.5 mg. q.d., Lipitor
80 mg. q.d. and Glipizide.  She has not used sublingual
Nitroglycerin although she has this.  
 
Her blood pressure today is 128/80 and her heart rate is 50 and
regular.  Chest is clear. Cardiac exam reveals a II/VI left sternal
border systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft and nontender. 
Extremities are free of edema.
 
Ms. Kelli Westyn-Nuel is doing well. We will check her LDL
again today to make sure it did not rebound to a higher level
following her myocardial infarction.  We will also check her liver
function test because of her statin therapy.  We may in the future
need to adjust her nitrates to a more rational once per day
regimen, but her current situation is so stable that we will leave
her medications as is.

New Patient Visit







Chief Complaint of:  2nd opinion



History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden. He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.





Impression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

Reason for Visit	

Annual physical exam.



Problems	  

breast carcinoma	      

S:  The pt. is five years S/P modified radical mastectomy, with 3 of 14 nodes involved, with a poorly differentiated intra-ductal carcinoma.  She's been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. since that time and is being followed by Dr. Quy Cherry.  For the past several years she has been on 20 mg. of Tamoxifen b.i.d.

O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast.

A:  S/P left radical mastectomy for ca. of the breast, with no evidence of recurrence.

4.   Smoking history.  Patient quit smoking in 2/74 after using a 
     Habitrol patch and has not smoked since.
 
5.   Hypercholesteremia.  Patient had an elevated cholesterol of 319 and 
     triglycerides of 751.  Although these were not fasting levels.  It 
     is suspected the patient will need to have medications to control 
     her hypoglycemia.  Will set her up with the Nutrition department 
     for now for a modified diet.
                                              7-20-74
 
 
 
6.   Elevated blood pressure.  Blood pressure is borderline at this 
     point.  Will recheck and have the patient adhere to her no-added 
     salt diet.
 
Patient will follow up in 10/74.  Will call the patient if her Micronase 
dose needs to be increased.  She will have an appointment with the 
nutritionist in order to start a no-added salt and low cholesterol diet.

HPI:  Ms. Stephenson is a 57-year old woman who has a history of multinodular 
goiter status post a hemithyroidectomy 7 years ago, and 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years complicated 
by diabetic retinopathy.  She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin 
replacement.  She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with 
Dr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse 
practitioners.  She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively 
compliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease 
process appears to be limited.  She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a 
day, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day.  She describes 
intermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood 
sugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the 
non-detected range most often.  She has not had any new visual blurring, 
excessive polydipsia or polyuria.  She has not been taking her Synthroid 
medication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out 
of the medication.  She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and 
has not noticed any significant difference.  She denies excessive fatigue, 
palpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about 
potentially restarting this medicine.  She has no other specific 
complaints.  She has a good energy level.
 
Social History:  She works at Nvidia and lives with her son.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Habits:  She does not drink.  She had quit smoking a year ago, but has 
been smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning 
on stopping this.
 
Physical Exam:  Blood pressure 148/83.  Pulse 70 and regular.  HEENT exam 
reveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe 
without specific nodularity or tenderness.  She has no adenopathy.  Her 
oropharynx is clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam:  
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs.  Her abdomen is 
obese, soft and non-tender.  She has abnormal pigmentation across her 
skin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral 
edema.
 
Assessment/Plan:
 
1)   Diabetes mellitus.  Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a 
     hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor.  We have talked about 
     good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine 
     dipsticks.  
 
2)   History of multinodular goiter. I will send a TSH today to assess her

     need for Synthroid replacement.
 
3)   Routine health screening.  She does not need a pap smear.  She has 
     had a TAH; however, I will perform a mammogram on her today.  She 
     will come back and see me in one month to get the results of these 
     tests, and we will make treatment decisions at that time.

Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
was positive.  She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.  She had 1mm 
and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
disease.  She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
vigorously, which is rapidly walking.  She vehemently denies that she 
has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
 
We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
 
PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.  She 
refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
for taking it.  She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
on atenolol.  
 
Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.  
 
We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.  I will continue to work 
with her strenuously on risk factor modification.  Her other risk 
factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.  Her 
diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
 
She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
hospital.

I saw this patient on 07/15/2086 in conjunction with Dr. Echols. 

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 68-year-old female with leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known coronary

artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes, status

post left fem-pop bypass and transmetatarsal amputation of her

left foot at the Siouxland on 05/02/2086.  This was complicated by

acute renal failure with creatinine between 1.6 and 2.4 and

labile sugars.  She was discharged to rehab on 04/19/2086 for

approximately 1 month.  Subsequently, she developed left thigh

erythema, swelling, and pain along the incision site yesterday. 

She has had no fevers, nausea, or vomiting but has had difficulty

ambulating due to pain, denies any diarrhea but has had some mild

stomach upset.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable as I said for hypertension,

diabetes, CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism.  She had MIBI in 2084 with LAD and

D1 lesion.  Her EF was 35%.  She had a CABG in 2083.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, atenolol, aspirin,

hydrochlorothiazide, insulin, Lasix, lisinopril, Norvasc,

Synthroid, Zocor, and Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in no

acute distress, however, distinctly uncomfortable.  Vital signs: 

Temperature is 97.2, pulse 59, respiratory rate 20, blood

pressure 148/67, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  For

full physical exam findings, please see the resident's written

note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, abdominal exam, and neurologic

exams are within normal limits as documented.  Respiratory exam

reveals crackles at the bases but no respiratory distress. 

Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. 

Musculoskeletal exam:  The fem-pop incision on the left leg is

concerning for purulent drainage along the incision site,

especially along the upper aspect of the upper thigh.  There is

approximately an area of 8 x 5 cm of erythema, induration, and

tenderness surrounding the area draining purulent material.  The

patient also has a transmetatarsal amputation.  The wound there

is clean, dry, and intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count of 10.9, BUN and creatinine ratio of 30:1.4 respectively.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Surgery was consulted regarding

this likely wound infection.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and

Flagyl were their request for antibiotics.  These were

administered in the Emergency Department, and the patient will be

admitted for likely operative debridement of this wound

infection.

Mr. Fredrick returns to clinic three years following right middle lobectomy for T1N0 carcinoid.  He is a 50-year-old man without symptomatic complaints.  He denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He had a recent chest CT scan which was of concern to him.

On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  No supraclavicular, cervical or axillary adenopathy is noted.  His blood pressure today is 132/92, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 86.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 98% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 16 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 228 pounds.  Chest examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally to percussion and auscultatory examination.  He has good chest wall excursion and no evidence of wheezing.  He does not have any egophony.  His abdomen is soft, nondistended and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly; and his extremities show no evidence of edema, cyanosis or clubbing.  The surgical wound is well-healed.  There is no evidence of local recurrence.

The chest CT scan shows two small nodules that do not appear to have significantly changed given the correction for volume averaging. The area of his previous resection shows no suggestion of recurrence.

In summary, Mr. Fredrick has two small pulmonary abnormalities that are not particularly suggestive of recurrent disease.  I agree with Dr. Ordonez's plan to repeat the CT scan in four months.

REASON FOR SDU ADMIT:  NSTEMI;  Awaiting cardiac catheterization

CC:  55 y.o. male w/ DM type 2, hyperlipidemia, positive family history for CAD, and hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who p/w NSTEMI



HPI:  

Mr. Fredrick is a pleasant 55 y.o. male with cardiac risk factors of recently diagnosed DM Type 2 (NIDDM), hyperlipidemia, and extensive family history, as well as, hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presents with chest pain, and found to have NSTEMI at Modesto State Hospital (MSH), transferred to SSH for cardiac catheterization.  Patient woke up on 1/16/05 with intermittent, stuttering ""pressure-like"" substernal chest pain, rating 7 out of 10, lasting from 15 minutes to 45 minutes.  He is very active with walking exercises, and gardening, and had not experienced this type of pain before.  The pain radiated down the left arm, his left jaw, and shoulder, as well as, causing ""throat tightness"".  He denied associated SOB, DOE, diaphoresis, palpitations, fevers, chills, N/V/D, or any other constitutional symptoms.  He took an ASA 81mg PO x1, called his PCP, and presented to MSH.



In the MSH ED, his vitals were as follows:

T: AF   HR: 109   BP: 169/81   FS: 248

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 104bpm with ST depressions in V3-V5.  He received morphine 2 mg IV, ASA 325 mg, SL TNG x 2, Lopressor IV 5 mg x 3.  The chest pain resolved, and the pt has been chest pain free since.  6 hours after presentation he had 7 beat run of VT. He has not had anymore chest pain since the ER but did have palpitations with VT run. He feels his heart being 'irregular' at times.  He was started on IV heparin and an IV 2b/3a inhibitor, and transferred to SSH on 1/17/05 for cardiac catheterization.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN

55 y.o. male w/ NIDDM, hyperlipidemia, POS family hx, and XRT to chest for Hodgkin's Lymphoma (2086), who p/w an episode of NSVT and NSTEMI, transferred from MSH for cardiac catheterization.  He is currently on ASA, Heparin IV, and Integrilin.  His CK-MB has already peaked, and remains hemodynamically stable.



1. ISCHEMIA: Troponin I elev and CK-MB peaked at 21.  He has already peaked his CK-MB, and appears stable.  On ASA, Lopressor, and Lipitor.  Will give Lipitor 40mg PO QD, and not 80mg PO QD, due to mild transaminitis.

- Continue Heparin IV and Integrilin IV.  

- Holding Plavix given risk of 3 vessel disease, and need for CABG

- Pt has tolerated IV contrast in the past, so will plan for cardiac cath on 01/18/05 per Dr. Orosco

- NPO after midnight tonight



2. PUMP: 

- On Lopressor

- Will add ACE-I or ARB after cath



3. HYPERLIPIDEMIA: 

- Continue Lipitor 40mg QD



4. DM2: 

- On RISS

- On Cardiac and diabetic diet

- Nutrition Consult for cardiac and diabetic diet teaching



5. LFT ELEV: Trend LFTs

PROBLEMS:  Ms. Youngman is a 37-year-old woman with the following 

medical problems:

1.	Diabetes.

2.	History of polysubstance abuse.

3.	Recent bilateral pyelonephritis.

4.	History of CIN 2 and laser to cervix.

5.	Depression.

6.	CAD with ischemia on MIBI in October 2093.

7.	Gallstones.

8.	Status post appendectomy in July 2093.

9.	GERD.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include glyburide 15 mg p.o. q.d., Prevacid 

30 mg p.o. q.d., atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. 

q.d., enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Celexa 20 mg p.o. 

q.d., and trazodone 150 mg p.o. q.h.s.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today 

for follow up regarding her diabetes.  Since I last saw her, she 

has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid 

October.  Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 

repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 

essentially within normal limits.  She denies any recurrent flank 

pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.  Says overall she is feeling 

relatively well.  She is taking all of her medications as 

prescribed.  She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, 

fatigue, or blurry vision.  She continues to smoke.  She has not 

been exercising.  She also continues to have intermittent chest 

pain of unclear etiology.  Several days ago, she had an episode 

that lasted a minute or two at rest.  She described it as a 

tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 

nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.  She has 

no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 

symptoms in the past few days.  She has not been taking her blood 

sugars at home as her machine is broken.  Also, she self-

discontinued her lisinopril.  She thought it gave her a headache.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 

distress.  Pulse 68 and regular.  Blood pressure 134/84 and 

weight 226.  Fingerstick today 198.  Neck veins are non-elevated.  

No carotid bruits.  Oropharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear to 

auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.  

Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Extremities are warm and without 

edema.  Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 

vibration and light touch.



LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 

normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-

waves.  Hematocrit and troponin are pending.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 

problems as follows:

1.	Type 2 diabetes.  Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 

the 9.0.  She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 

try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.  At this point, it 

is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 

regimen starting with b.i.d. NPH, and we will refer her to the 

diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 

with a plan to transition her at that time.  Her urine 

microalbumin was negative a few months ago.  We will recheck 

her hemoglobin A1c today.  She has been to the ophthalmologist 

recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.

2.	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 

pain is somewhat concerning.  She does have coronary disease 

as per her MIBI just over a year ago.  She is taking an 

aspirin and a beta-blocker.  Her EKG today is normal, and she 

has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 

exertion.  Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 

pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 

the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 

and beta-blocker.  I will repeat her stress test to see if her 

ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 

referring her to Cardiology.

3.	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 

prefer better blood pressure control.  She agreed to try the 

lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 

thinks it disagrees with her.  I told her I felt the headache 

was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.

4.	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 

I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 

today without receiving one.  

5.	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

                     CARDIOLOGY OFFICE NOTE
 
NOTE
     Ms. Uher returns after a 4  year hiatus.  She is now 52 and
has long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h/o retinopathy
OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy.  She
had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally
well since that time.  Over the past year she has not been as
careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her
sugars regularly.  A random cholesterol w/i the past year was over
300.
     She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the
anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea,
diaphoresis or light-headedness.  There has not been any reduction
in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year
ago and is working full-time.  There has been no orthopnea, PND or
peripheral edema.  She is interested in increasing her physical
activity program.
     Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age
20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father
developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's.  She is
perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her
gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.
     Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.
 
EXAM
     She is comfortable at rest.  BP 110/76, HR 80 and reg.  No
JVD.  Carotids full w/o bruits.  Chest clr.  Cardiac exam shows
normal heart sounds w/o gallop or murmur.  Abd. soft w/o
organomegaly.  No peripheral edema.
     Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis
and is a normal tracing.
     For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help
gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed
using the standard bruce protocol.  She exercised for 9 minutes, 8
seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of
chest pain or inordinate dyspnea.  Peak heart rate was 143 (85%
maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure. 
There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work
load.  Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4
seconds longer.
 
IMPRESSION
     1.  No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time. 
She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a
perimenopausal state.  She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as
her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid
profile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be 
PAGE 2
UHER,OLGA

instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.  From a cardiac
standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.  Low
dose aspirin therapy could also be considered.
     I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac
evaluation as needed in the future.

RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb

SRI: 		134-43-51



Dear Dr. You:



Thank you for asking me to consult in the care of this complex patient.  Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.  He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.  He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.  After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.  He denies any history of trauma.  He is a former smoker.  He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.  He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.



Past surgical history is as above.



Medications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.



No known drug allergies.



Review of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.  All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.



Habits, he is a former tobacco smoker.  He denies alcohol use.



Family history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.



On physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.  Respiratory rate is 12-14.  Pulse is 60-70 and regular.  Weight is 172 pounds.  Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.  No jugular venous distention.  Normal respiratory effort.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur or bruit.  He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.  Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.  On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.  He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.  No varicosities.  He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.  The right great toe is blanched.  He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.  He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.



Assessment and Plan:  



1. Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.  We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.  We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.  If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.

2. Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.

3. Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.  His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.  We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.  

4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.  I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.  



Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management.  If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.  



Sincerely,

I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Jaquante Xuereb, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here at the Santa Rosa Infirmary today.  As you remember, he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem-pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below-knee popliteal artery.  He returns today for follow up evaluation. 



He has a warm, well-perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  Unfortunately, over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis.  He had been on a course of p.o. antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well.  The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema, tenderness or drainage from his leg.  My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics, bedrest and elevate.  We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures, treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis.  In addition, he has intact femoral pulses on the left side.  He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region.  Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 29, 2070 reveal an ABI of 0.96 on the right, 0.56 on the left.  



I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb.  My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level.  If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.





Sincerely,





Shane R. Herring, M.D.

RE:  Gerald, Marion 

MRN: 48967301 

DOV: 05/18/83



Dear Dr. Olive,



Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.  She is 

referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.  The patient states she is 

currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 

developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.  This continued to bother her 

and she eventually was treated with steroids.  I am not sure she had a 

diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.  She then was switched to ibuprofen which 

did not work particularly well.  Over this time, she would have intermittent 

episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 

her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.  She was seen by 

Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 

she had ""25 shots"" of steroids.  She denies any hot or swollen joints.  She 

has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.  Extensive ROS reveals 

no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.  She 

has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 

well.  She has continued to be concerned about that.  She has had fevers or 

chills but no temperature elevation.  She has intermittent abdominal pain but 

has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.  She has 

morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.



Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.  Mother is 

85.  Two sons alive and well.  Two siblings alive and well except for 

hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.



Past medical history is pertinent for above.  She has had a partial 

hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.  Medications 

include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 

metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 

q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.  

No smoking or drinking history.  No allergies.  No other medical problems.



Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.  She works as a 

midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.  Her husband is 

a Broadcast Technician.  They have traveled quite a bit because of this.

Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.  Weight 152.  BP 

120/80.  She had a respiratory rate of 16.  She had full range of motion of 

all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 

cervical and lumbar area.  Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.  

No oral ulcerations.  Good salivary pool.  No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 

or axillary adenopathy.  Chest: clear to A&P.  No carotid bruits.  Vascular 

exam: normal.  Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.  

Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: without 

edema.



I suspect she has fibromyalgia.  I do not really know the place of steroids 

in this setting.  I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 

CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.  I will see her back in four 

to six weeks.  She will get old records for me to review.  We will talk about 

what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 

have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.  

I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.



Sincerely yours,

(449) 515-0294





REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up cholesterol and new problem of chest

pain.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Gerald is a 61-year-old patient

with history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids,

hypothyroidism and I now have available old records from previous

doctor, Yesenia Olive.  The following issues addressed:

1.  Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any

symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.  Maintained on Glucophage

1000 mg b.i.d.  Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day

is around 120.  We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.

 Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.

2.  Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will

be less than a 100.  She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day

and LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256. 

We will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.

3.  Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is

acceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.

4.  Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood

pressure is currently acceptable.

5.  Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation

rate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in

the past.  No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a

history of recent chest pain.

6.  Exercise-induced chest pain.  The patient has noted over the

past month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest

when she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.  This

subsides when she stops and rests for a while.  This has been

reproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her

husband.  Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had

thallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted

heart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.  EKG showed 1 mm ST

depression in leads II and V4 through 6.  The thallium scan

showed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior

walls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending

artery distribution.  She does not recall having symptoms at that

time.  Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with

chest discomfort.  There are some radiation into both shoulders

and neck.  Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,

diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,

Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro

150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d. and Glucophage 500 mg two

tabs b.i.d.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel

habits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.  Temperature

of 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.  Pupils are equal,

round and reactive.  Conjunctivae clear. Sclerae anicteric. 

Oropharynx benign.  Neck is supple.  No neck vein distention. 

Thyroid is not palpable.  Chest is clear to percussion and

auscultation.  Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,

thrill or gallop.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds

and no organomegaly.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or

edema.  Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  No

abnormal complex.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes.  We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she

has had an ophthalmologic follow up.  Maintain Glucophage.

2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.

3.  Chest pain.  Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.  I have

contacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an

ETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.  I prescribed nitroglycerin

1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes. x 3 for chest

discomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.

 Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add

beta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing

heart block.

4.  Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current

Levoxyl.  The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and

cardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.

	Interval History:
   Per HPI J. Jordan Duran:

64 y.o. male with known CAD. He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095. At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling. He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally. He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes. 

He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA. His ejection fraction at that time was 40%. He was referred for surgery. He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1. 

He now presents with recurrent chest burning. He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG. His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest. He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis. During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test. Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds. He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved. MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility. There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct. His ejection fraction is 46%. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending. Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod. ostial stenosis, LIMA-LAD 100%, LM mild, LAD severe w/ distal 100%, LCx OM 100%. Plan is for med management.

	BETHANY BRETHREN HOSPITAL

	



	Reason for visit:

   Mr. Eubanks is a 68 yo man w/ recently diagnosed CAD s/p LAD stent.



	Interval History:

   Mr Eubanks presents for hospital followup after presenting to BBH in January 2149 w/ after he developed 2 episodes of chest pain lasting 1-2 minutes each and not associated with any symptoms.  On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.  Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology.  Cardiac markers were negative.  Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at Pennsylvania Hospital, patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2/47, followed up with normal exercise echo in 5/47.



On first night of admission, patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom.  Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit.  He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation.  RCA with moderate disease.  LCx with distal disease.  

Patient was transferred to the SDU for further care.He was started on beta-blockers and ace-inhibition, and tolerated these medications well.  He was evaluated for cardiac rehab. Of note, patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow-up CT in 3 months.

Record date: 2084-08-25

61 yo man with CAD and PVD referred by Dr. Short for pre-operative evaluation prior to vascular surgery.



He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. Returns today feeling well and has been active painting his fence and going up and down stairs without any chest pains or unusual SOB. Has had a hematoma in the groin.



MEDICATIONS:  Serevent.  Flovent.  Enalapril.  Colchicine. Alopurinol.

Albuterol.  Viagra.

 

ALLERGIES:  None. 

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 57 after his 8th MI.  He had his

first one at age 48.  Mother had a stroke in her early 50s.  His brother, Shields,

died a miserable death with recurrent, inoperable laryngeal cancer.

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married.  Continues to work as a sales representative.  He

has an adopted child, Xiao who is now 14 and doing very well in school. Quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.

 



ROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Does not exercise. Last cholesterol was  175/42.     The rest of the review of systems was negative. 



PE: General: Looks well.

================ Vital signs ================

Blood Pressure:   150/80 142/80   130/78

Pulse:   84   [Regular, Radial]

Weight:   222   [Pounds]

Skin: Chronic ischemic ulcer on the medial aspect of his second toe of the right foot.

HEENT: EOMI. PEERL. No scleral icterus. Bilateral cataracts. Benign pharynx.

Neck: No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. No cartotid bruits.

Lungs: Decreased breath sounds. Wheezes.

Cor: JVP is normal. PMI is not displaced. Heart sounds barely audible No murmurs. No gallops.

Abd: Normal bowel sounds. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness.

He has a small echymosis of the left inguinal area. Bilateral femoral bruits. 1+ right femoral pulse. I cannot palpate the left pulse.

Extremities: No pedal edema. Ulcer as above.



EKG done in the office shows NSR at 74. Axis 90. Normal intervals. He has Q's in V1-V2 c/w possible OASMI. He has low volts in the precordial leads c/w chronic pulmonary disease. No changes from previous.



================ Problems ================

PRE-OP EVALUATION   He has rest ischemia of the toe. He has three vessel coronary disease that is asymptomatic. There are no indications at this time to push for CABG. He underwent angioplasty to try to improve flow to the anterior wall. His EKG suggests OASMI but his ventriculogram is normal without evidence of MI and EF of 59%. There are studies showing increased risk of in-stent thrombosis, MI, death in patients who have had Plavix stopped for non-cardiac surgery within two weeks of stent. He will be beyond the two week period and Dr. Short is willing to operate on him while continuing Plavix and aspirin. I believe he is an acceptable risk for surgery.



PVD   Will need surgery for ischemic ulcer.



COPD   Doing well and is stable. Instructed to use his inhalers faithfully in the preop period.

       

GOUT    No flares this year.

      

HYPERTENSION    Better when rechecked. He gets nervous with the initial measurements.

      

IMPOTENCE         Discussed the fact that, now that he has documented CAD, there is increased risk with Viagra use. He understands that but indicates that he feels that for him personally the benefits outweigh the risks.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Followup of diabetes.

SUBJECTIVE:  Jennifer states that at home her blood sugars by fingerstick 
typically went around 170.  She feels well.  She is not having any chest pains or 
palpitations.  She is followed by cardiology at PMC, Dr. Samantha Noland.  Her 
current medications include atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. and Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d.

&#183; Urinalysis:  negative



&#183; Radiology: CXR:  IMPRESSION:

     Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly. 

       

&#183; EKG: Regular rate, sinus rhythm, indeterminate versus right axis. Frequent PVCs, Anterior Q waves, prolonged QT



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.  Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.



I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.  His murmur is quite impressive.  Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.  



Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.



1.        CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.  Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight.  Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP.  Repeat echo in the am.  Strict I/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.  If EF is depressed, will start beta blocker, consider aldactone.

2.        Substance abuse &#8211; Will obtain Johnson Rehab consult for alcohol and cigarettes.

3.        HTN &#8211; Poorly controlled, captopril

4.        Elevated blood sugar &#8211; Will obtain fasting BSs and right for sliding scale insulin.  Will obtain HgbA1C

5.        Hyperlipidemia &#8211; LDL 128 in 2090.  Will start statin and check fasting lipid panel in am.

6.        Restless leg syndrome &#8211; Likely 2/2 iron deficiency anemia.  Will replete till ferritin &gt; 50 before treating

7.        Iron deficiency anemia &#8211; Will start iron sulfate, recheck ferritin.



F/E/N:  low salt, low fat/cholesterol diet



PROPHYLAXIS:    GI: none   DVT: fragmin    BOWEL: colace/senna   CODE:  FULL

REPORT
     BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM
     The present study is compared to previous films.
     There are scattered fibroglandular densities.
     There is architectural distortion and skin and trabecular
     thickening involving the left breast that are consistent with post
     treatment changes.  There is no evidence of new or recurrent
     disease.
     No suspicious mass, calcifications or architectural distortion are
     identified in the right breast.  A clip and calcifications are
     noted in the upper outer quadrant from prior benign percutaneous
     biopsy.
     There is no mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right
     breast.
     

IMPRESSION
     Post treatment changes involving the left breast with no evidence
     of new or recurrent disease.
     No mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right breast.
     BI-RADS Category 2 Benign Finding
     
     
RADIOLOGISTS:                           SIGNATURES:
     XI, KATHERINE I                              XI, KATHERINE I
 


Impression and Plan:

1) Uncontrolled DM: A bit improved. Now with premeal values mostly in low 200s. Will increase to 1000 mg qpm since her AM values seem to be higest. Eventually will need to be on maximal doses of metformin (2550 mg qd). Hypoglycemic event management reviewed.
Still with frequent dietary indiscretions, such as eating candy and pizza on regular basis.

2) Diet modification reviewed.

3) HTN/proteinuria: Not optimally controlled. WIll add atenolol for now. Rationale for this reviewed with pt. Cont. ACEI and adjust next time based on microalbumin. Previously referred to renal for eval.

4) Osteoporosis: Stable. Cont. Fosamax. Reviewd proper use-drinking of water and staying upright for at least 30 minutes after taking pill.

5) Smoking: 5 cigs per day per pt. Risks and options discussed. Urged cessation. 

6) H/o breast cancer: Stable. F/u with Queen Newton 9/73 and Dr.Mitchell 12/73.

7) abnormal LFTs: recheck in a couple of months.

8) H/o noncompliance: reviewed in detail with pt. ""busy schedule of appts"". Urged compliance.

Encounter 40 min. more than 1/2 of it in face to face review of meds, education/counseling about DM management, rationale for medical regimen, HTN, compliance issues, smoking cessation and above.

She was discharged from NGH to rehab on 1/8/2075 after ORIF of a right humeral fracture. She feels that she has been doing fairly at rehab. On the evening prior to admission, however, she had some anxiety that resolved after receiving Ativan from her nurse. She then was able to fall asleep but woke-up at 2AM with diaphoresis and SOB. She denied chest pain. She was attended to and her BP was 220/117. She was given 2 SL NTG, O2, and Lasix, after which her SOB somewhat improved but her HTN continued. She also complains of a chronic cough that is productive of white/yellow sputum. She denies missed medications, changes in diet, adding salt to meals (although she is at rehab and her diet order is unclear). At this time, she denies CP, SOB.

MICROBIOLOGY: None


RADIOLOGY
1. CXR: Lungs:  The lungs are satisfactorily inflated. There is increasing
prominence of the interstitium and peribronchial cuffing when compared to the prior study consistent with interval development of CHF.  Surgical clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax.  No definite focal consolidation is demonstrated. Pleura:  There is no pneumothorax. The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study.  This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF.


2. Bilateral LENIs: NO EVIDENCE OF FEMORAL OR POPLITEAL DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS OF
EITHER LEG.


EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 95. Normal axis. Normal PR, QRS, QT intervals. No ST elevations or depressions.  ? Q waves in v1, v2, v3 but also may be upslopes before the downslops. However new since 12/12/2074




ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN


Mrs. Ito is a 69F with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephritic syndrome, and 1/15/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN. Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema, as she has had in the past. The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however. She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive. It is possible that HTN 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.  Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN.
 
1. Shortness of breath/CHF: Evidence of volume overload by exam and imaging. PE also on the differential but seems less likely given improvement of resp status, negative LENIs. 
-- Lasix 40mg IV now 
-- Strict I+O
-- Daily weights
-- F/up PA/Lat
-- Continuous O2 sat monitor;Telemetry, cardiac monitor
-- f/up cardiac enzymes
-- ASA 325 qd
-- Will give Lopressor 25 Q8 and Captopril 50 Q8 for now but may need to reconsider the BB if CHF less compensated. 
-- Albuterol and atrovent for possible COPD component given tobacco history
-- Consider TTE in AM
-- Consider PFTs


2. Leukocytosis: Infection vs stress response. Patient presents with elevated WBC with 80% polys. Infectious work-up has included U/A that is negative for infection. CXR does not show evidence of focal consolidation, however may be obscured by pulmonary edema. Mental status at baseline. I am suspicious for PNA given her report of productive cough howeve do not feel pressed to treat at this time as she is afeb. 
-- Cont to follow fever curve and WBC
-- F/up PA/Lat
-- Consider addition of abx for HAP if fever, PA/lat concerning
-- F/up Blood cultures and sputum cultures
-- F/up c diff


3. Hypertension: Home HTN regimen is Atenolol 50mg QD, HCTZ 25 qday, Lisinopril 40 qday, Losartan 50 BID
-- Start Captoril 50 mg Q8 and Lopressor 25 q8 and titrate up as needed fo tight BP control 
-- Cardiac monitor


4. DM type 2: Home regimen is Metformin/Glucotrol. 
-- D/c oral agents and start Insulin SS w BID BS


5. Hematuria/Proteinuria on U/A: Consisent with prior U/A


6. Breast CA: Cont Arimidex (hormone tx)


7. HL: Cont statin


8. Depression: Cont Prozac


9. Tobacco use: Cont Chantix 0.5 mg PO QDay


10. Anxiety: Ativan PRN at home. 
 
11. FEN:  Low chol, low sat fat, ADA diet with no added salt. Cont Vit D/ Calcium
 
12. PROPHYLAXIS:
GI:  Not indicated    DVT: Heparin 5000 Units SC BID    BOWEL:  Colace/Senna PRN


13. CODE STATUS:   Full Code       (Discussed with patient)

ID:  T2 N 0 M X, ER/PR + Her 2 Neu negative left invasive ductal carcinoma


Reason for visit: Monitoring of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer


Initial Oncologic History:  
Ms. Ito first palpated a left breast lump in 2070. Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In March '72 a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. 
On 3/22/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5/31/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.


INTERVAL HISTORY:  
Returns to see us for regular 6 month follow up. She had follow up chest imaging with her PCP which did not show evidence of pna. She is happy to hear this. She reports she is doing well at home. Son agrees. He is in the process of remodeling her home so it is handicap accessible. She can dress herself and wash herself. No new breast symptoms, pain or other concerns today.

Patient Name: LAGNSTON, SHERMAN I.;  MRN: 7223692
Dictated at: 12/09/67 by GARY J. HUGHES, MD 

 
FOLLOW UP NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1.  Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.  
 
TUMOR STATUS:  Not available.  
 
NORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.  
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.  He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little ""fuzzy.""  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  
 
PLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.

HPI:   	 

61 yo male (CRF:former smoker, HTN, obesity) present with 4-5 days of increasing chest pain.  



Patient reports that he began having pain at the R sternal border, no radiation 4-5 days ago.  Patient unsure when pain initially began.  Patient describes suprasternal pain, sharp pain that felt like  gas pain.   Initially lasting for minutes.  Pain came and went without any correlation with activity.  Episodes increased in frequency and intensity over the days.  Exercise did not worsen his pain and was able to climb 2-3 flights of stairs without exacerbation of symptoms.  



Pain has been increasing in intensity over the past 4-5 days.  Pain became unbearable and patient finally presented to BRA. Pt did not have any clear STE's,  given IV nitro, heparin, and ASA.  Evaluated by BRA Cardiologist and transferred to CCH CCU for further workup. 



Pt had similar pain past summer and 1 year ago while walking up steep hill

GI CONSULT NOTE 								10/27/2070



Patient: Langston, Sherman

Unit #: 7223692

Location: Ol 11

Referring Attending: Null



Reason for consult:  BRBPR



HPI: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of CAD s/p stents of LAD lesion in February 2070 readmit with chest pain.  At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals.  He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent.  This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring.  The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins.  He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin.  In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding.  Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today.   This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative.  Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum.  He had no abdominal pain.  No further bleeding since this morning.  He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix.  His colonoscopy in 2066 revealed diverticulosis.  He is currently on aspirin, plavix, heparin with therapeutic PTT.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

62 year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.  This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.  He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.  There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.  There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.  Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.  No alteration in medications required.

Personal data and overall health

			

  This is a 63-year-old man status post renal cell CA and coronary artery disease.



Reason for visit

			

  Followup multiple medical problems.



Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

The patient had recatheterization in May demonstrating 30% stenosis at the stent on the LAD.  He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization.  His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia.  His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly.  He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise.  The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly.  He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth.  He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently.  He also occasionally feels this at rest.  He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90.  He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging.  It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know.  He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks.     01/13/2072: .  The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070.  He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue.  He has no chest pain or palpitations.  He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much.  He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50.  He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.  He does have cold extremities.  There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea.  He remains on beta blocker, lipitor, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, and warfarin.  He is no longer on Plavix.  He has no nitrate.  On exam, he is somewhat hypertensive, but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP.  His EKG shows first-degree AV block and I have asked him to bring that to Dr.  Null's office today.  

A: Stable. 

P: Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today.  We would not escalate



Elevated blood pressure

The patient is on Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol.  He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors.  I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient remains on 40 mg of lipitor.  It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today.  He has been fasting for 12 hours.



Iron deficiency anemia

We will recheck his indices today.  He is not fatigued or pale.



Renal carcinoma

The patient had repeat MRI and CT in January at the Healthwin Hospital.  These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six-month intervals.  He is quite reassured by this.



Seborrheic keratosis

The patient is ready for evaluation by Dermatology.  He has several atypical-looking keratoses as well as poorly rounded lesions consistent with BCCs.  I have referred him to Dermatology today.



Sinus congestion

/ 5/10/64=&gt;/and stuffiness, no ear ache, no sore throat, no shaking, chills (saw Dr.  I have reinforced the wisdom of taking some nasal steroid at HS.

RE:  Peggy Tinsley
     MR #236-67-03-3
 
Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.  This patient
with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.  She has been doing well
except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
the past week.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
pain.  She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.  Her blood
sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.  
 
Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
NPH 10 units qam.
 
On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.  CBC at the time
revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.  Blood
cultures were sent.
 
On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
and a pulse of 88.  She was afebrile.  Head and neck examination
was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.  On cardiovascular
examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
peripheral edema.  Heart sounds were normal.
 
Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
protein and 2+ glucose.
 
Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. 
There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. 
She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
tract infection.  Because of her early satiety she has been
eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

This patient was seen in combination with Dr. Lance Camacho.  His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.  She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

History of Present Illness:  
Per Dibble General Hospital Records, the patient was admitted on 2/04/33 after collapsing in the mall.  His total time down is unclear, but the patient had an AED administered and he was shocked x2.  When EMTs arrived, they found the patient to be in VF w/ agonal breathing.  CPR was administered and he was shocked x3.  After the 3rd defibrillation, the patient awoke and was in NSR.  The patient could not recall any of the events.  

At DGH, was hemodynamically stable and did not have a recurrence of malignant arrhythmia.  His EKG showed TWI v3-v6.  His troponins went from 0.01-0.27-0.34, CK 451 w/ MB 28 (full laboratory values not available).  TTE showed depressed LV function w/ EF 30%, w/ apical apical dyskinesis.  Head CT was negative for acute process.  His mental status demonstrated slowly recovering delirium.  He was found to have a pneumonia and treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  His arrhythmias were treated with amiodarone IV, transitioned to po.  He was transferred to NAMC for cardiac catheterization.

EKG SB at 57bpm, Q in v1, III/AvF, left axis, TWI in v3-v6, new from previous.  QTc 430ms (manually calculated)
CXR enlarged cardiac silhouette, L basilar opacity.

Impression/Plan: 
68yoM h/o HTN/HL, schizophrenia, medication non-compliance presents s/p VF arrest, NSTEMI, AMS.  Patient likely had ischemic VT/VF.  Per outside records, the patient does not seem to have ongoing activity of his acute coronary syndrome.  His mental status continues to be poor, and is likely multifactorial; my suspicion is that he does have some level of anoxic brain injury as the dominant pathology.

NSTEMI:  npo p MN for cardiac cath in AM.  Patient not able to consent at this point, and does not have any clear family members that can do this for him.  Will follow his mental status exam.
	-aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor, heparin IV.
	-can add ACEi when he is taking po   s and if BPs need further titration.
	-mucomyst for renal prophylaxis.
	-for risk factors, check a1c.
S/P VF ARREST: likely in the setting of NSTEMI
	-cath as above.
	-nl QTc
	-s/p amio IV load.  C/w amiodarone po load.  If reversible lesion, likely can d/c.
AMS: anoxic brain injury; current somnolence likely from narcotics.
	-appreciate neurology consultation
	-head CT
	-c/w home zyprexa.  Haldol prn.
BRONCHOSPASM: does not have significant smoking history.  ? aspiration vs cardiac wheezing
	-albuterol/ipratropium nebs standing, and prn.
	-gently diurese
	-finish course of antibiotics; ceftriaxone/azithromycin until 2/12.
CHF: mild failure
	-lasix 40iv x1.  goal TBB    500-1L
	-follow creatinine, as he apparently bumped at OSH.
U/A: check urine culture
FEN: npo while somnolent.  Otherwise, low fat/chol, no added salt.  
PROPHY:  on heparin IV.
CODE: FULL (patient cannot answer for himself)

HPI: 
68y M s/p recent NAMC hospitalization after having a vfib arrest at the mall on 02/04/33, with defibrillation x 5 in the field (3x by bystanders, and 2x by EMS). Pt converted to NSR in the field. He was stabilized at Blakely House, then transferred to NAMC. At NAMC, patient had electrocardiac cath, which showed 3vd disease and Dr. Albright   s team was consulted. As pt was encephalopathic s/p arrest, he was transferred to Fremont Medical Center on 02/21/33, where he was rehabilitated and his mental status improved. At FMC, his diuretics were titrated (lasix 20 mg -> 40 mg), and psychiatry weighed in on his posthypoxic encephalopathy. He is transferred back to NAMC today in preparation for CABG, planned 3/07/33.

-Technically Difficult Study-

Sub optimal parasternal images.

MITRAL VALVE
There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus.  There is no evidence
of mitral valve prolapse.  There is no evidence of mitral regurgitation by
color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM
The left atrium is dilated.

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT
Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic
valve is tricuspid.  There is evidence of trace aortic insufficiency by color
and spectral Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE
The left ventricular cavity size is dilated.  The left ventricular systolic
function is moderately impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic
with regional variation.  The estimated ejection fraction is 35 %.

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.
There is an insufficient tricuspid regurgitation Doppler profile to estimate
an RV systolic pressure.

RIGHT VENTRICLE
The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function
is within normal limits.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

2/11/33 Left Heart Cath
1) Three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The Left Main is large and has only mild irregularities.  The LAD is
diffusely diseased (30 - 40%) and has a distal 80% stenosis.  The Left Cx is
totally occluded The LCx receives faint collaterals from the LAD territority.
The ramus branch has diffuse disease with a 80% proximal stenosis and a 70% mid
stenosis.  The RCA is occluded proximally and there are right to right
collaterals. There are 80% mid and 80% distal stenoses in the RCA.
2) LV gram shows EF of 30%, with anterior/apical akinesis and inferior
hypokinesis.
3) Right dominant system

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Xanthos,
 
We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.  We will
not repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three
months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
and tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a
relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
of breath.  An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
 
On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
pounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The
lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked
cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
facial hair over the past several months.
 
In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
uremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to
recheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she
undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.  Although renal
failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
 
Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

Speciailists: Carroll (Cardiology)Chief Complaint Abnormal stress testHistory of Present Illness 55yo M with a history of IDDM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ESRD (on HD), h/o DVT (positive lupus anticoagulant), osteoarthritis was scheduled for elective hip surgery 3/29/77. For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
 
The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed. After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter. He was also given Warfarin 8mg PO x 1 for an INR of 1.6.Review of Systems negative except as abovePast Medical History 1. IDDM (A1c 6.9, neuropathy)

Dear Dr. Nunes:
 
Thank you for asking me to see Mr. Craft. Patient says he was diagnosed 
as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
Xian and was treated with steroids at the time. It's not clear what CNS 
or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex 
partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
estradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available 
testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing 
fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He 
said his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to 
explode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was 
vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
right. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
postnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and 
anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
other results). He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis 
on his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth 
or gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth 
removed. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other 
cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI 
problems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to 
benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR. Dr. Nunes

A PSA has been normal. Past history of kidney stones. He's allergic to 
penicillin, Lozol, allopurinol and bee venom. Has a past history of 
diagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. Sleeps fine. No history of fractures. 
Only operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and 
appendectomy. Bruises easily, frequently has headaches. Has been diagnosed 
as being bipolar. Exercises.
 
Recent MRI consistent with a ""vasculopathy.""
 
Family history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died 
at 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also 
smoked. He is an only child.
 
Social history. Doesn't smoke. When he's depressed he becomes a binge 
drinker. Exercises when he's not depressed. He's retired since 2103. Was 
a stage manager.
 
Physical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160/80. 
Pulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on 
forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One 
small node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. 
Bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. 
Hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the 
forehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs. Abdomen, 
no organs, masses, tenderness but obese. Extremity, joint exam fine. 
Neurological fine.
 
I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. 
However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to 
also exclude lupus and vasculitis. Basically I told him to take Flonase 
twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
cleared up. 
 
In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the 
testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of 
testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease 
estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding 
hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. Patient 
also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
regarding increased appetite, decreased memory,

decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased 
hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of 
cholinergic transmission problems.
 
Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
Aricept to improve his memory. Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted. 
 
Thank you again for asking me to see him. Please let me know if I can be 
of further assistance. 
 
Sincerely yours,
 
 
 
Richard Aviles, M.D.
 
PS: If you could give me some information of what evidence there was 
that he had systemic lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus back in 2103 at 
the Vermilion Hospital, for instance the discharge summary from the Vermilion Hospital, that would be appreciated.

RE:Craft, Lloyd
MRN:26649180
 
Dear Dr. Short:
 
Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr. Craft for the 
possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.  As you know, he 
is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
history for a rheumatological disease.  His past medical history, 
briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.  
All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.  He was 
treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
symptoms and seizures went away.  Since that time, he has had a 
recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
neck, pressure within his head.  He considers himself to have 
vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
salivation and increased appetite. In describing his headache, he 
noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
quality.  It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.  There is no 
family history of migraines as well.  Also during his headache 
events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
nausea or vomiting.
 
Past medical history:  As per above.  Medicval issues include 
bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
migraine headaches.  
 
His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n. and 
prednisone p.r.n.  
 
He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.  
There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
remission.

Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.  
 
Social history:  He is a former stage manager.  
 
Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.  Attention 
was normal.  Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic 
errors.  There is no memory deficit or agnosia.  The patient gave 
a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
status testing was performed.  Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
fields were full.  Disks were sharp.  Fundus was clear.  
Extraocular movements were intact.  There was no nystagmus.  He 
had normal facial sensation and symmetry.  Hearing was grossly 
normal.  Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.  Motor examination 
revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.  Deep tendon 
reflexes were symmetrical.  There was no upper motor neuron sign.  
Coordination and gait were normal.  
 
Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
of lupus in the past.  His recent blood work shows that his 
double-stranded DNA was negative.  Taking into consideration his 
current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular 
disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of 
central nervous system vasculitis.  He was told that he is at a 
high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood 
pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.  If it is 
possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start 
a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and 
also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d. for primary prevention 
of heart disease.  He was informed that it is possible that there 
is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his 
hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his 
symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is 
not clear.  
 
Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.
 
Sincerely,

Assessment/Recommendations:

69 y.o. male with obesity, BMI = 35 -> 32/33, with known complications as listed above.  Causes of this patient's obesity include genetic predisposition, past medications (prednisone, antidepressants?), emotional/compulsive/binge-like eating related to manic phase of bipolar illness.   



Pt continuing comprehensive program of individualized nutritional education addressing meal structuring, portion control, food choices, etc. and psychological counseling addressing emotional contributors to eating and weight gain.  Seeing Paul Edwards RD, and Allison Ng, PhD.  Lost 18# in 4 months (1 pound a week) so far with nutritional change, exercise.  Commended pt on success.



Pt will continue exercise (walks 4 mi/d, gym 2 (going to 3) times a week for an hour, swimming).



Because of the afternoon period he describes as being like a ""Warewolf"" (4-7 pm), I recommended he use this time for exercise rather than for his other, more sedentary, activities.



At a later time we can consider medication (in this case, orlistat).  Currently progress is excellent without needing it.



Discuss elevated BP with PCP, may need higher dose of ACEI.



F/U w/ me 2 - 2.5 mos.



>50% of the 30-minute visit was spent counseling the patient about the potential implications of obesity and obesity-related conditions, and the above treatment plan.  All questions answered.

Neurology Attending Staff:


July 8, 2122
Time of exam 1:05 PM
Patient: Lloyd Coleman
Reason for admission: headache, gait instability, mental slowness


I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Craft who has been admitted to the Neurology service for evaluation and management.  Along with the Neurology Residents, I personally interviewed, examined, and counseled the patient, confirmed the history and findings, reviewed records and studies, and discussed the impression and recommendations.  For greater details of H/P/ROS/meds/exam/labs/studies, and assessment &amp; plan, please refer to the neurology resident admit note by Dr. Robert Neil (and below under my assessment). 


ROS performed across 10 systems are negative (as noted in neurology note) except as noted in Hx/Assessment and resident's note. 


Cognitive and Elemental neurologic exam as noted in neurology resident note. 
Of note, AFVSS, was asleep but awoke to voice and became alert, attentive to examiner, but had moderate psychomotor retardation. Was slowly conversant and followed simple multiple step commands across midline. 
Oriented to time/date/place. 
Great d/w simple attention (MOY backwards only to Nov, skipped Oct went to September and then went forwards again). 
Able to perform complex attention and working memory bihemispheric Newberry location alpha-numeric task after a second trial. 
Language: fluent w/o dysarthria. Farily Intact naming for high and low frequency items except clasp and had some mild retrieval d/w. 
Memory: gives good details of recent events including hospitalizations. 
Leprosarium name and address: 5/5 registration --&gt; 2/5 recall in 5 min --&gt; 1/3 recognition from a list
Presidential candidates = Xayarath and Golden
Calculations: # of quarters in $6.75 = 27
Moderate d/w Luria fist-side-palm that improved w/ verbal cuing but still poor L&gt;R. 
No EDSS, neglect, R-L confusion or apraxia. 
Mood: ""low ... my daughter has cancer that spread to the bones""; Affect: congruent. 


CN's II-XII intact, good up and down gaze and w/o IV or VI CN palsy. 
No PND, abnl movements, tremor, asterixis, or UE ataxia. Slow but okay FFM, FNF, RAM. 
Full MS, nl DTR's and tone. Plantar responses flexor. 
Mildly diminished stocking distributaion of LT/Cold/VS both legs to mid-shins. HKS mild d/w. 
Unable to stand w/ feet together even w/ eyes open. Moderate retropulsion trying to stand and moderate to severe retropulsion w/o spontaneously recovery on pull-test. Narraw base, small step size w/ low steppage, cautious and w/ retropulsion, slow rate w/ 10 step en bloc turning w/ imbalance (backwards). 
No photo- or phono-phobia, no nuchal rigidity.


Labs/Studies: of note BUN 21, Cr 1.2, MCV 95, Hct 41.6, wbc 13.3


Neuroimaging: Personally reviewed HCT - mildly large vents, no s/o SDH or SAH or infarct/mass lx/hemorrhage. 


Assessment:: Likely Communicating Hydrocephalus with mild elevation of ICP in context of minor head trauma.  On exam shows psychomotor retardation, d/w concentration, retrieval (including memory and words), frontal fucntions including set-switching on Lurias, and working memory. He also has moderate retropulsion on exam worse on pull-test than spontaneously, and hypomimia. His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8/10 pressure at posterior vertex w/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f/c/ns/cp/sob/rash/weakness/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo. Does ascribe rare very transient visual distortion and object movement (up/down). WBC mildly elevated but no fever and U/A and CXR are negative. 


Overall, there is a diad of gait apraxia and frontal cognitive dysfunction and psychomotor retardation (no urinary incontinence) in context of sx's of mildly elevated ICP and mildly enlarged vents. Has a mild small and large fiber distal symmetric polyneuropathy which exacerbates his gait difficulties. He is also at least mildly anxious and moderately anxious.  Had bradycardia in ED - now better but need to follow. 


Plan: 

- Optimize pain/headache control
- Neuro checks q4hrs
- Cardiac telemetry
- Elevated ICP (mild) precautions with HOB &gt; 45 degrees; and gentle hydration (he is dehydrated by labs)
- MRI of brain to better assess vents and possible transependymal flow, as well as to exclude much less likely brainstem and posterior fossa lesions. Also need to assess posterior circulation w/ MRA (had mild constant tinnutus), and assess for small SDH (b/o h/o head trauma). 
- check B12, homocysteine, TSH, ESR, hsCRP, ANA

- After Brain MRI is reviewed, need to assess fundi, gait and cognition (formally score and time) and then perform diagnostic LP for hydrocephalus -- measuring opening and closing pressure after removing ~ 20cc and sending for cell count, glucose, TP, and xanthochromia as well as keeping ~ 10 cc. 

- Hold sotalol, complete cardiac/MI r/o by enzymes. 
- Follow wbc and monitor for s/s infection. 


Discussed assessment and plan with pt and family who understand and agree.

Problems and Plans
1: CAD Plan for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting on IABP, tenative date for 5/01.   Echocardiogram pending to eval for valvular disease and EF.  If needs valve surgery, he is edentulous.  Have consented for both pending results.  + recent ASA.  On heparin. 
2: CNIS Pending.  Has Hx of RICA disease in 2095. 
3: Pulmonary H/O Asbestosis.   Serial CT's demonstrating nodules.  Discussed results with Dr Troyer.   Plan to proceed with surgery for now, and reeval post op. 
4: Renal CRI noted.  Perhaps secondary to Lisinopril or EF.
Pt and family aware of possible need for dialysis. 
5: Diabetes Mellitus Type II Presently oral control. 
6: Preop Issues - labs pending
- Cardiac surgery consent completed for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting +/- valve surgery pending echocardiogram results.

	Note: There is an addendum for this note (6/10/2097)
		


	Reason for visit:
   Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.


	Interval History:
   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097. At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. 

He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%. 

He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents. 

His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. Hardin. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. 

He was discharged from rehab on June 5th. On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation.

	Assessment and plan:
   CM/CAD - with recent CABG and coronary stenting, now admitted via the EW with dyspnea and hypoxia. Initial cardiac enzyme screen is negative, but BNP markedly elevated. Based on exam, suspect a combination of CHF and pleural effusions (diuretic medication was not being taken at prescribed dose accidentally). Will admit for diuresis, if significant effusion not improving with diuretics, may need thoracentesis. If BP allows, will resume low dose ACEI tomorrow. Check echocardiogram to assess EF and pericardial effusion. continue aspirin and Plavix. 

Recent DVT - on Fondaparinux - please continue and ask Dr. Hardin to see while in-patient (known to him). 

DM - continue current regimen, follow and cover as needed.

MR #099-04-65-0

08/28/86

 

I saw Mr. Tanner today for a routine follow-up visit.  I last

saw him in November of 2085.  In May he presented to the

emergency room with dehydration and hyperglycemia.  Diagnosis of

non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was made.  He is now on

Glyburide and metformin.  His renal function at that time was

normal with a BUN of 15 and creatinine of 0.90.  His potassium at

that time was 4.6.  Otherwise, he is doing pretty well.  He has

lost about 40 lb.  He has seen a nutritionist regarding dietary

counseling.  

 

Today his weight is 258 lb.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Heart rate

100.  Current medications lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,

hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q.d., Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.,

metformin 500 mg t.i.d., diltiazem 180 p.o. q.d.   Urinalysis

shows 3+ blood, 4+ protein.

 

IMPRESSION:  #1)  Thin based membrane disease with persistent

hematuria and proteinuria.  #2)  History of renal ________.  

#3)  Type 2 diabetes.

 

PLAN:  Continue current medications.   Continue high water

intake.  Encourage weight loss and compliance with his diet.  

 

I spent some time talking to him about the importance of weight

loss and controlling his diabetes given his underlying kidney

disease.  Follow-up visit in nine months.

Mr. Tanner RTC to discuss diabetes, BP, weight, lipids.



HPI: He has been overweight for some time, and was found to have DM II about two years ago. I had treated him with:

GLYBURIDE  5MG PO BID

METFORMIN  500MG PO TID

LISINOPRIL  40MG PO QD

DILTIAZEM CD  180MG PO QD

HCTZ  12.5MG PO QD



however he enrolled in a study, and when it was over he was put on:



DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 



When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month. He feels well. He says he's lost 10 lbs. since his last visit (262 lbs. on 2/26 - 263 lbs. today) but he's interested in a weight loss program.



MEDICATIONS

DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD

SH: single, Ground Transit Operators Supervisor at HASBRO.



Habits: no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol;



ROS: denies weight change, fever, chills, fatigue, blurry vision, chest pains, palpitations, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel/bladder habits, joint pain, dizziness, exanthem, edema. No concerns about pain, functional status or nutritional status.



PE notable for:

Well nourished well appearing obese WM;

VITAL SIGNS

BLOOD PRESSURE  152/84

PULSE  68

WEIGHT  263

HEENT: sclera clear white OU, EOMI, ear canals and TMs wnl AU; oropharynx without lesions.

LN: No palpable neck or SC LN;

Cardiac: RRR, rate   68 , no extra sounds

Resp.: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds



Plan:

1. by his account DM control is still poor, which is not surprising since he previously required 10 mg of glyburide and 1500 mg of metformin per day. For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.

2. also poor BP control for a diabetic. Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD. It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.

3. MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.

4. discussed necessity for weight loss for DM, BP, lipids.

5. RTC 1 month.

Dear Dr. Truong:



We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.  As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.  Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.  He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.  The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.  Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.  Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.  He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.



On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.  His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.  His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.



His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.  A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.  A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.



We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.  We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.



Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.



Sincerely,

EDVISIT^50294530^FOUST, FAY^01/31/95^SULLIVAN, MILTON

The patient, Foust, was seen in the Emergency Department on

01/31/2095.  The patient was seen by Dr. Ferrer.  I have

discussed the management with him.  I have also seen the patient

personally and reviewed the ED record.  This is an addendum to

the record.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old woman who said

this morning she went to the bathroom, was sitting on the

commode, felt chest tightness, and then had a syncopal episode. 

She has never had this chest tightness before.  She is unsure

whether she hit her head.  No shortness of breath and no

exertional symptoms in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nonsmoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well appearing in no acute

distress.  She has no chest pain or discomfort within the chest

in the Emergency Department  Initial blood pressure systolic 218

was reduced to 190 range with beta blockade with initial pulse of

62.  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck has no midline

tenderness.  She has full range of motion without pain.  Chest is

bilaterally equal and clear.  Heart is regular.  Abdomen is soft

and nontender.  Extremities are nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit of 40.2.  Initial CK and troponin

were negative.  EKG shows lateral ST depression, most prominent

in lead V4 through V6.  There is no old available for comparison

at this time.  She also has T-wave flattening in I and aVL.  On

repeated questioning, the patient has no symptoms.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a woman who had a syncopal episode.

 She had chest tightness prior and has an abnormal EKG.  After

clearance of the head CT, which shows no bleed, the patient

received aspirin.  I have discussed admission with Dr. Melton who

is admitting for the Cardiology team and the patient has been

accepted.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is admitted.

CONDITION:  Stable.

CXR: Clear.



CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.



TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.



A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.   



1. Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.  It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.  However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.  Ischemic event is less likely in this man.  EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.

Other possible causes include:

  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently.  However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.

  	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.  

Plan:

1)	Continue hydration overnight. 

2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.

3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.

4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.

5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.



2. DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.  Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.  Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.  

1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI.

2)     Q6h finger stick check.

3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.



3. L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.  Tender to palpation and with joint movement.  No signs of infection.  Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.

1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture.

2)     PT consult.



4. FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).  Eating PO.  On IVF for hydration.

1)	Replete Mg.  

2)     K now 3.6.  If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.

3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.



5. Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin. 



8. Dispo: PT consult.  Anticipate home discharge.

PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
                                              7-21-79
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
me.  I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
disease, hypertension, and diabetes.  The patient has had a positive 
exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.  However, patient was 
overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
approximately 50 lb. at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.  Patient was seen last night 
in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.  
 
On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.  His exam was 
notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.  
His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
well.  His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, 
did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.  An 
abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.  IVP 
was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.  He was given Toradol 
in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.  I was called by 
the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
flank.  On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was 
brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.  On exam 
he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
abdomen.  Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
peritoneal signs.
 
Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I 
feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
undergo this study this afternoon.  I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to 
rule out pancreatitis.  Of note, patient does have a history of peptic 
ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and 
reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.  He is also 
status post cholecystectomy.  I will review his IVP later today and make 
further therapeutic interventions at that time.

December 10, 2098  Endocrine/Diabetes



Present Illness:  

Asked to see this 89 year old patient of Drs. Pina and Keefe, admitted with an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure in the context of severe aortic stenosis and less attention to diet at the time of his wife's death last week. He is approaching probable AVR and ? CABG. 



He has had diabetes since age 50. He was treated with diet initially, then chlorpropamide (100 mg bid at the time of admission) to which metformin (1000 mg bid at the time of admission) was added. His recent A1c was 6.5 %. He denies hypoglycemia and does not have hyponatremia. His creatinine is 1.5. He has never used insulin until this admission, when his oral agents were stopped and Lantus begun.

Retinopathy:	Reports that he does have retinopathy, but lost vision OD to macular degeneration. He is followed by Dr. Valentine and Dr. Wilkes, and reports that he has had laser treatment by Dr. Valentine.

Nephropathy:	BUN/Cr 42/1.5 

Neuropathy:	Decreased sensation in feet and hands. Notes that he has had flat feet all of his life and does not recall any acute painful episode in L foot.

Cardiac:	above

Vascular:	No claudication



Pre-op evaluation has included colonoscopy and EGD because of guaiac positive stool. An incidental bladder mass is suspected on the basis of pelvic CT and ? cystoscopy is also planned.



Past Medical History:  

Surgery:	Lymphoma - treated with surgery and radiation therapy in 2077 or so

	TURP

	Tonsillectomy

Medical:	Hypertension

	Anemia

	Asbestosis

	Pulmonary nodule

	Pulmonary fibrosis

	GERD

	Nephrolithiasis

	Depression

Allergies:	?? Sulfa - he thinks that he has had sulfa since the time he was labeled with an allergy to it but cannot recall details.	



Family History:  

MGF had diabetes.



Social History: 

His wife died last week of Alzheimer's Disease, several months following a fall.

He is a Financial Senior Manager. After the successful treatment of his lymphoma at about age 68, he went back to school to study sociology.



Review of Systems: above

Review of systems is otherwise negative.



Physical Exam:	

Delightful elderly man in no distress.

BP:   148/59		P:   64, regular

Wt:   165 by history, down from maximum of 235		Ht: 5' 10     by his estimate, down from 6' 1.5   

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Fundi:	Not examined

Carotids:	2+,= with softly transmitted murmur

Chest:	cleat\retinopathy

Heart:	Normal S1; single S2..  No gallops.  3/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	1+ ankle edema. Pop 1-2+ R, 1+ L. No pedal pulses.  R foot has small plantar arch, but L has no arch and bony prominence in the location of plantar arch; there is also some deformity of the  L ankle.            

Neurological:	AJ absent. 



Impressions and Plan:	

  	89 year old man with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and longstanding type 2 diabetes.

  	His average control has apparently been good on the combination of chlorpropamide and metformin, although we cannot be sure of that in view of his anemia and the fact that he was not testing his glucose at home.

  	Metformin is relatively contraindicated since his GRF is certainly diminished with creatinine 1.5 at age 89. 

  	Lantus does not appear to be the right insulin for him. Would D/C it in favor of NPH 15 U in AM (watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect). Check QID BS but cover with scale only before  breakfast and supper. I have not addressed the issue of long term insulin use with him, although it would be my first choice. Even at his age, I suspect that he would have no difficulty mastering it given his relatively youthful mind. Other alternatives would be sulfonylureas (if forced to use one, would choose glimepiride) and glitinides, for example repaglinide.



Thanks. Will follow.

FINDINGS



Ankle-brachial indices, segmental systolic pressures, and pulse volume

recordings are obtained at rest.



RIGHT:  ABI is .62.  Waveforms and pressures demonstrate SFA, popliteal,

and/or tibial vessel disease.  Perfusion is poor to the digit level.



LEFT:  ABI is .37.  Waveforms and pressures demonstrate iliac, SFA, popliteal,

and/or tibial vessel disease.  Perfusion is poor to the ankle, TM, and digit

levels.



Of note, multiple attempts were made to obtain toe pressures, however, this

proved to be technically impossible due to patient's constant twitching.



IMPRESSIONS:

1. RIGHT SFA, POPLITEAL AND/OR TIBIAL VESSEL DISEASE, WITH MODERATE ABI

REDUCTION, AND POOR DIGITAL PERFUSION

2. LEFT ILIAC, SFA, POPLITEAL AND/OR TIBIAL VESSEL DISEASE, WITH SEVERE ABI

REDUCTION, AND POOR PERFUSION TO THE ANKLE, TM, AND TOE LEVELS

3. TECHNICALLY UNABLE TO OBTAIN TOE PRESSURES





A/P:  This is a 85yo male s/p AVR, CABG with chronic pressure ulcerations at his soles bilaterally secondary to proximal disease. Recommend foot elevation when at rest, heel protection, specially-fitted shoes. 

Will D/W Dr. Quiring  for endovascular intervention.

	Reason for visit:
   A 63 yr old man with CAD and extensive PAD history s/p multiple peripheral PCI's admitted after elective cardiac &amp;amp; peripheral angiography and LSFA cryoplasty/PTA/stents.


	Interval History:
   Patient is a 63-year-old with long-standing right-greater-than-left claudication 
The Fall of 77, he could only walk about 25 feet before experiencing 
pain. Exercise ABI's revealed R ABI drop from 0.65 to 0.16 and L ABI drop from 0.74 to 0.24. An MRA revealed non-obstructive plaque in the common iliacs, 50% left external iliac and question of disease in right internal iliac; 40 to 60% common femoral and 40 to 50% stenosis more distally with 60 to 70% serial left SFA stenoses. He had a totally occluded anterior tibialis bilaterally with 60 to 80% trifurcation area disease and high grade posterior tibial on the right and occluded posterior tibial on the left. 
10/77 he was admitted with angina and ruled out for an MI. A cardiac catheterization revealed 50% focal LM lesion, mid 100% LAD lesion, 60 mid LCX, 50-70 OM2, 40-50 dominant RCA distal lesion with an EF of 65%. He has been treated medically without any further angina. 
. 
11/77 peripheral angiography revealed 40-60% LIIA lesion, 50-80 LSFA stenosis, 40-60 L profunda lesion, totally occluded L AT &amp;amp; L PT, R EIA 60% lesion, RIIA 40-60 proximal &amp;amp; 70-90 mid disease, totally occluded R AT &amp;amp; R PT, 70-80 R peroneal. The LSAF was treated with PTA/Xpert 6 x 60 stent, the R EIA lesion was treated with Palmaz Blue 6 x 24 stent. 
6/78 he was taken for peripheral angiography which revealed 30% REIA ISR, mod-sev bil IIA disease, R SFA 70-75, TO AT/PT and 50-60 peroneal. The proximal R SFA was treated with PTA, mid was tx with DCA/PTA 
Since then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief. In addition, he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain. He also has been experiencing claudication with left leg worse than right which has been preventing him from performing exercise. 

A ETT MIBI was done 10/31/78 where he exercised for 3 minutes 53 seconds. He complained of b/l leg claudication and chest pain and actually fell on the treadmill because "" his legs gave out"". Imaging revealed anterior, apical and septal ischemia as well as an EF of 49% and anterior and septal HK. Dr Barton put him on trial of Nitrodur, however, he developed lightheadedness and it was stopped. 
He was referred for cardiac and peripheral angiography. 
Preliminary Cardiac Cath reports reveals TO LAD with distal LAD filling from RCA collaterals (unchanged from previous cath). Peripheral angiography was performed and cryoplasty was performed to the LSFA for ISR as well as Precise 6x30 stent to LSFA and Cypher 2.5x30 stent to the tibeo-peroneal trunk. He arrived on Cardio. divis. in NAD.

Resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation reviewed

by me and I concur.  In addition, I personally interviewed and

examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male with

history of elevated cholesterol who presents for evaluation of

intermittent neck pain and arm discomfort over the course of the

last several weeks and now with substernal chest pain radiating

to the neck since 6 hours prior to admission.  The patient does

not have any documented history of CAD.  He has noted over the

last several weeks episodes of exertional right-sided neck aching

and arm discomfort with arm numbness, which seems to occur with

exertion and resolve with rest.  He has no noted over the last

week, but on exertion, he has had episodes of bilateral neck

aching discomfort with radiating achy into both of the arms.  His

symptoms generally resolve with rest.  Today, approximately 6

hours prior to presentation, he was driving when he had the onset

of bilateral neck and arm aching pain with substernal chest

discomfort, shortness of breath, a sensation of palpitations and

mild sweatiness.  He had no nausea and no vomiting.  His symptoms

persisted over the course of last several hours, and he presented

to the Emergency Department for evaluation.  He denies any prior

history of chest pain in the past.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive only for elevated cholesterol and

questionable history of PE in the past.  He did smoke in the past

and drinks occasionally.  He lives with his significant other.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is positive for early CAD in his

father.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Other systems are reviewed and otherwise

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Only Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  No medical allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 95.2, pulse 96,

respirations 18, blood pressure 121/65, and the O2 saturation is

94%.  The patient is awake, alert, middle age male who appears

mildly uncomfortable but in no respiratory distress, reclining on

the stretcher.  Head examination is normocephalic, atraumatic. 

His pupils are equal and reactive to light.  His sclerae are

anicteric.  His conjunctivae are pink and moist.  He has moist

mucous membranes with no erythema.  His neck is supple and

nontender.  The trachea is midline.  There is no adenopathy. 

There is no JVD.  He has full range of motion.  There is no

subcutaneous emphysema.  His lungs reveal mild tachypnea.  There

is no chest wall tenderness.  There is no accessory muscle use. 

He has bibasilar crackles in both lower lung fields.  There is no

wheezing and equal breath sounds.  His cardiac examination is

tachycardic and regular at about 100 with a 4/6 systolic murmur

heard prominently at the apex as well as at the right second

intercostal space.  There is no rub.  His pulses are normal.  His

abdomen is minimally obese but nondistended, soft, nontender, no

guarding, no peritoneal signs.  There is no organomegaly and no

pulsatile masses.  His skin is intact, warm, somewhat moist but

not diaphoretic.  There are no rashes.  Extremities reveal no

cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Calves are soft and nontender with

no palpable cords, full range of motion with normal strength and

tone.  He is oriented x3.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is

no motor or sensory deficit.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access

initiated.  He was placed on a cardiac monitor.  EKG was

performed.  He received 1 time sublingual nitroglycerin with a

drop in his blood pressure to systolic in the high 70s.  A second

IV was placed.  Right-sided EKG leads were performed, and the

patient received IV fluid bolus.  He had already received

aspirin.  His white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 41, and

platelets 175,000.  His electrolytes are within normal limits. 

His BUN is 18, creatinine 0.9, and glucose 124.  His CK was 93. 

His troponin was less than assay.  His initial EKG showed normal

sinus rhythm in the 80s with a normal axis, normal intervals. 

His pseudonormalization noted only in lead III.  He has

approximately 1.5 mm ST depression with normal ST segments in the

anteroseptal leads with somewhat hyperacute appearing T waves. 

Right-sided leads show some mild, less than 1-mm, ST upward

sloping in V2 through V5.  He had a chest x-ray performed that

showed a normal mediastinum and some mild fluffy alveolar

infiltrates in the bases but no obvious consolidation and no

significant cephalization.  He had blood pressures checked in

both arms once his blood pressure improved after an IV fluid

bolus and was noted to have a persistent 20 point difference in

systolic blood pressures of 136/65 on the right and 111/65 on the

left.  When the patient was questioned about this, he states that

he has had that noted in his doctor's office in the past.  He

underwent CT scanning of the chest, which ruled out aortic

dissection after discussion with the attending radiologist.  As

his blood pressure stabilized, he received IV Lopressor and

became pain free.  He did not require any further nitroglycerin. 

Repeat EKG was performed showing resolution of the 0.5 mm ST

depression in the anterior leads.  Given the patient's cardiac

risk factor and his history, which is fairly worrisome for

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

with a diagnosis of chest pain, rule out new-onset angina.  He

does remain pain free now and has maintained a stable blood

pressure after IV fluid bolus.  See the note for full details.

Critical care time was 45 minutes.

SDU ADMISSION NOTE



PATIENT:  XAYAVONG, BRANDON

MRN:  7826250

ADMIT DATE: 6/13/2082

PCP: DR. ERNEST EDGE

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: DR. ASHLEI TYSON

OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: DR. BRIAN MOSS (772-261-4350)



CHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.



He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).  Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.  He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).  



He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.  He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.  He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.  To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.  However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.



On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.  Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.  EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).  He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.  For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.  Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.  (He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)  CXR by report was clear.  With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.  Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w a couple days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.  He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR, with moderate response to IV amiodarone load and bolus but hypotension.  He has known multivessel disease felt by report to be a high-risk CABG candidate, and is doubly referred for heart transplant evaluation.



# CV/RHYTHM: Afib/RVR, with generalized nonspecific symptoms

- Not ideally controlled on amiodarone given hypotension, but can tolerate SBP 90s given this is his baseline and no evidence of hypoperfusion

- Trial digoxin low-dose versus cautiously titrating diltiazem or metoprolol

- Bolus NS as needed for low BPs

- High risk for clot given likely prolonged Afib, however, CHADS is 2 or 3 (HTN, DM, ?CHF)

- Heparinize, hold on Coumadin bridge in case of possible procedures

- Tele, replete lytes



# CV/ISCHEMIA: Known multivessel disease, difficult to CABG per OSH cardiologist

- ASA, hold BB/ACEI given hypotention, statin, niacin, check lipids

- Given no clear cause for Afib and comorbid with DM, trend cardiac markers

- Ongoing outpatient eval for CABG 



# CV/PUMP: Unknown EF, mild crackles on exam, taking lasix QOD at home. Relatively euvolemic.

- Continue lasix QOD regimen

- Check TTE for new WMA, worsening cardiomyopathy

- Will discuss plan with Heart Failure service



# DM: Hold glipizide, metofrmin while in house. RISS + FSBG AC/HS



FEN: cardiac



PROPHYLAXIS

GI: home PPI

DVT: on heparin

BOWEL: prn regimen

REASON FOR ADMISSION

Tailored therapy



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Xayavong is a 62 year old man with a history of CAD (s/p STEMI and multiple stents), CHF (s/p BiV ICD, class D and stage III), DM, and CRI who was admitted for tailored therapy after a routine RHC demonstrated elevated filling pressures.



Mr. Xayavong has a primary cardiologist (Dr. Marshall) in Gloucester and has received much medical care at Oregon City Hospital.  He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC.  He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD.  He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.  Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis.  He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.  He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.  At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.



He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.  He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.  He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.  He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.  Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.  He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.  He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.  He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.  He denies recent fevers or chills.  He has no complaint of leg swelling.

sized vessel. It bifurcates into the LAD and LCX coronary arteries. Left main coronary artery is normal.



LAD: The Proximal LAD has a diffuse, irregular, and thrombotic 90 % stenosis in its proximal third.  D1 has a focal 90 % stenosis in its ostium.  The Ramus has a focal 95 % stenosis in its ostium. Both the D1 and Ramus side branches arise from the thrombotic proximal LAD segment.



Left Circumflex: The left circumflex coronary artery is moderate sized vessel, which gives origin to two obtuse marginal arteries. The artery contains only minimal irregularities.



RCA: The right coronary artery is a large vessel. The artery contains only

minimal irregularities.



TTE (6/15/82)

Assessment
: 
63 year old RH man with history of CAD s/p STEMI 2077 s/p 8 stents including LAD, systolic CHF Class Ia with EF 20% s/p BiV ICD placement, diabetes, on Coumadin and ASA, presenting with history of right arm/leg weakness since this morning.  There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.  Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.  He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE. He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.  NIHSS was zero.  CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.  There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.


The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.  He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.  


Plan: 


- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
- Neuro checks q4 hours
- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.

- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
- Check blood cultures
- Check chromogenic Factor X level
- PT/OT evaluation
- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130




Thank you for this consult. Please page 90395 with any questions or concerns.

Re:	Jarome DEJESUS

Dear Dr. Ponce:



I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Dejesus during his ECI admission 05/16-07/14.  He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.  Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.  The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.  



He spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.  His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.  He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.  He has PT/INR check arranged in several days.  He will follow up with you in the next two weeks, and will see his PMD, Dr. Paige, in the near future.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please call if you have questions.



Sincerely,

Yoseph Berg, M.D.
Broome Developmental Center
84 Parkhurst Drive
Peculiar, NE  54583

Dear Dr. Berg:

We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Jarome Dejesus, during his admission to the Erie County Infirmary from 07/16/2157 to 07/17/2157 for evaluation and treatment of his anginal symptoms.  As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.  He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.  He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.  He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.  The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.  The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.  Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.  He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.

His heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.  He is in atrial fibrillation.  His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.  There is no hematoma or bruit.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.

His morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.  His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.  His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.  His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.

We are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.  He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.

                      OFFICE NOTE
  Rickey George
  MR#1131414
  October 05, 2092
  
  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.  
  
  PROBLEMS:
  
  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe. 
  Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.  Treated by Dr. Randall.  Underwent extensive
  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery
  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above
  knee popliteal bypass graft.  With this surgery, only his left second toe remained
  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.  
  
  He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.  
  
  Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of
  hospital discharge 9/9.  Will recheck renal function today.  
  
  Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on
  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.  His blood sugars are now in the normal
  range on no oral agents or insulin.  Will need to monitor closely through rehab.  
  
  CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d. of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.  At the time of
  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d. and not surprisingly he developed quite
  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.  He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
  up to 60 b.i.d. but he still has significant edema.  Will go back to 80 b.i.d. with close
  monitoring.  
  
  Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.  Will hold lisinopril
  for now.  Close VNA follow up.  
  
  COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.  Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.  
  
  Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
  and surgery with blood loss.  His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
  and he was being started on Epogen.  Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has
  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a

  week.  For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.  Given his
  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.  
  
  Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no
  anginal symptoms.  
  
  Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.  Generally weak.  Home services
  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is
  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.  
  
  Social history: wife very involved with his care.  
  
  Physical exam: BP 98/60.  Pulse 64.  Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop. 
  No rub.  Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.  Multiple well healed surgical scars. 
  Extremities: incisions in the groin.  No erythema.  Right groin several cm question cystic
  structure beneath the incision.  Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.  2-3+ edema in the
  extremities bilaterally.  Dry gangrene left second toe.  
  
  Disposition: 1. Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d. phone follow up within several days.  
  2. Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.  
  3. Continue Percocet for toe pain.  
  4. Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.  
  5. Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.  In the meantime, will
  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.  
  6. Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o. q.d. 
  
  Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
  about end of life issues.  Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
  other than his single toe at this point.  He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a
  BKA.  He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
  the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and 
evaluated by Dr. Wooten.  Please see Dr. Wooten's note.  The 
patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two 
days of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish 
sputum.  She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting. 
Minimal diaphoresis.  She has had a fever.  No urinary symptoms. 
She does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus status post coronary artery 
bypass grafting. 
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, 
albuterol and Nephrocaps.

MAMARONECK INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Orta, Phil
                                              55931516
                                              8-02-73
 
                                              
                                              
HPI:  Mr. Orta is a 50-year-old African-American man who has been 
treated for the five past years by LBH at Edgefield.  He was seen in MHC 
clinic prior to that.  His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone 
number is 872-9985.  Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact 
that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has 
not seen a physician in the past year.
 
His medical problems include:
1.   Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.  It is unclear 
     which vessels were plastied.  
2.   Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin 
     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.  However, he has not taken any 
     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well. 
3.   Anxiety.
4.   Condyloma last fall.
 
Medications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO 
q.h.s. prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.  Patient also had 
nitroglycerin tablets at home.  Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO 
t.i.d.; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.  
He does not have any history of hypertension in the past.
 
Social history:  He is currently not working.  He has been unemployed for 
a month and a half.  He used to be a social worker which did not 
involve any heavy lifting.  He did community services managment.  He 
lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.  
 
Review of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of 
chest pains over the last 10 years.  However, he does say that his last 
chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.  When asked where the 
pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the 
pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his 
angioplasty.  He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was 
relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.  At the 
time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.  He has no 
history of exertional angina over the last several years.  However, this 
complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.  He 
currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.
 
On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no 
apparent distress.  Temperature was afebrile.  Heart rate was 68 and 
regular.  Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting 
position.  HEENT was within normal limits.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  
Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Abdomen was benign.  Extremities were without edema or lesions.

Assessment and Plan:
 
1.   Cardiovascular.  Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given 
     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.  Given that he is on 
     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to 
     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d. in an attempt to 
     control his blood pressure and heart rate.  I also encouraged him to 
     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.  
     The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.  After he 
     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an 
     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
     evidence of ischemia at this time.  If he does, we will recommend a 
     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
     causing syms of rest angina.  The case was discussed with any 
     cardiacs that are on call.
 
2.   Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
     has at a level of 336.  He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.  I 
     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
     diet and explained which food contain those products.  I will also 
     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.  We will start him 
     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d. later this week.
 
3.   Daily anxiety.  Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
     Ativan.
 
4.   History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.  Patient 
     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
     his next visit.  If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for 
     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

Patient Name:  Urban, Russell

Provider Name:  Orozco, Jimmy

John Ussery, M.D.

Worthington Internal Medicine

28 Shattuck Street, IM 270

Citrus Ridge, MT 43782



Dear Dr. Ussery:



I saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today.  Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well.  He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note.  Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.  He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program.  He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.  He has stopped smoking.  There have been no difficulties with his medications.  



On 03/16/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis.  Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic.  He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.



His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.



Medications:

Aspirin 325 mg daily

Plavix 75 mg daily 

Lipitor 40 mg daily

lisinopril 10 mg daily

Coreg 6.25 mg daily.





Physical examination:

He appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure is 112/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular.  His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign.  His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.  He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs.  His abdomen is soft.  It is neither tender nor distended.  He has normal bowel sounds.  His extremities are warm and well perfused.  He has no edema.



Impression:  This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093.  Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent.  He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.  Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction.  The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.  There is likely a component of left heart failure.  In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea.  He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing.  This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.  



Recommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this.  The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them.  To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study.  If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly.  I will see him again in six months' time.



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.



Regards,

Physical examination:

			

-Pulse: 58  beats per minute and regular

-General:   He is well appearing and in no apparent distress.

-Neck:   His JVP is 4 cm. No carotid bruits

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

-Cardiac:   Regular in rhythm, but bradycardic. Normal S1 and S2. He has no S3 or S4. He has no audible murmurs.

-Abdomen:   Soft. It is neither tender nor distended.

-Extremities:   Warm and well perfused. No edema.

-BP: 120/72  mmHg. 



			EKG:

   Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise normal



			Assessment and plan:

   Overall, Mr. Urban is doing very well. He continues to be very active with no symptoms of angina or congestive heart failure. Currently, his lipids are under excellent control as is his blood pressure. Ongoing secondary prevention and risk factor modification will continue to be paramount in Mr. Urban's care. I have discussed these issues with him in detail. 



I would like to obtain another echocardiogram to re-assess his ejection fraction which has been low in the past.  Also, I would like to see if he has had further development of pulmonary hypertension.  He will continue his current medications and return to see me in six months' time or sooner if need be.

Diabetes mellitus

His current blood sugar readings are fasting 95-131 but 2 hrs after meals in the afternoon and evening have ranges from 159-276. he says his diet has been reasonable with a few exceptions when he has cheated and his blood sugar did reflect what he ate. I believe it`s time to change him to Lantus for better coverage. 

P I will change his NPH to Lantus 10units at bedtime he will continue testing at least twice a day and he says he is going to test at least 4x`s a day for a while. he is still on glucotrol which we may need to discontinue as not to increase his hypoglcemic episodes. I will mail him scripts to fill at his request and call him to review blood sugars and need for titration in about 2 weeks to give him enough time to be on the insulin for at least 1 week. 7/15/84 Home BS quite good! Low 100s 9/12/84.....In general, he has been failing at home, unable to care for himself, and requiring increasing VNA.

Dear Dr. Jean:




 

Your patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096 .  He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication.  Today,  Mr. Oswaldo  looks and feels well, and complains of no issues.    On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal. The  incision is healing very nicely.   


Chest radiograph reveals normal findings.  EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal.  His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker. 


Patient education was completed with respect to:  medication review, weight restriction/lifting/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.


Overall, I am quite pleased with progress.   He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.  He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.  


Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.  I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .  I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up. I am releasing  him to your care.  We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.  



With warm regards,  


Sincerely yours,

MARVINYANDELL,GRACE   904-68-07-1              VISIT DATE: 08/06/96

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year old 

woman who is being seen by Dr. Dodd who had what was a syncopal 

episode on the premises.  A code was called when bystanders and 

medics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.  The 

patient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the 

Emergency Department. 

The patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.  She took her 

medication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, 

nausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.  Her 

other complaint was mild back pain from passing out.  No epigastric 

pain or tenderness and no chest pain.  The patient never had any 

chest pain prior to her event.  She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history 

significant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and 

migraines. 

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, 

Calan slow release and Glucophage. 

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, 

Percocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.  LUNGS: 

Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 

murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal. 

GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 

was 160.  Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple 

leads.  No significant ST elevations. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 

year old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the 

premises.  A code was called overhead.  Bystanders reported that 

the patient was diaphoretic.  They gave her something to drink. 

Her blood sugar here was within normal limits.  The patient has no 

complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She looks well 

but does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs 

or gallops on her electrocardiogram.  The patient was made NPO 

because of her cystoscopy procedure. 

FINAL DIAGNOSES: 

1.  Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 

diabetes medicine this morning. 

2.  PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.  No 

old electrocardiogram to compare.  We need to address the PR 

depressions.  This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.  I 

would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis. 

3.  Cardiac ischemia. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 

need admission and a formal rule out.  She may even need an 

echocardiogram inpatient.  A full work up is pending.  The 

patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 

Aleta Nunley at 15:00.

CC: emesis, light-headedness 



HPI: 85 y/o with CAD and active ischemia on 6/87 stress test (medically managed) who was feeling well until last night.  During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.  In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart.  He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.  He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins.  The arm pain is not exertional.

	After the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.  A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.  After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.  He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.  He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.

	In the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ED this morning.  Admission vitals: 97.2, 120/78, HR 80's, RR12, sats 97% RA.  He was noted to be in A fib.  Hct was 22 (down from 38 last week).  NG lavage was not performed in the ED.  However, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by SL TNG x 3.  HR at the time of arm pain was in the 80's and ECG showed A fib with possible TWI in I,L and V6 but relatively unchanged from admission ECG without pain.  He subsequently received lopressor 2.5 IV/12.5 PO, isordil 10 PO and zantac 50 IV.

Studies:

EKG  AF (92) LAD TWI I,L,V6

CXR  IMPRESSION:

	There are linear opacities at both bases consistent with

	subsegmental atelectasis. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are

	consistent with asbestos exposure. There is no pneumothorax. No

pleural effusions are visualized.  There is extensive change including both shoulders.



Assessment:  85 y/o with medically management multivessel CAD who presents with light-headedness, fatigue and anemia.  Likely coffee gound emesis, melana and increased BUN concerning for UGIB.  Given history of alcohol consumption (suspect that consumption may be slightly more than given by history) and NSAID use, gastritis is a possibility.  No clear reason for other sources of UGIB.  Pt also found to be in Afib of unknown duration.  Unclear if Afib was prompted by anemia due to UGIB.



Plan:



1.	UGIB

a.	Active blood back sample, IV access

b.	Hct increased from 22.2 to 24.7 after 2u pRBCs.  Given CAD history, will transfuse one more unit

c.	GI consult for possible EGD (pt likely also needs colonoscopy given h/o tubular adenoma)

d.	IV zantac 

e.	Hold aspirin for now

2.	CV

a.	Ischemia - TVI on admission on ECG from ED.  Will cycle cardiac enzymes.  Hold aspirin for now given GIB.  Continue beta blocker both for ischemia protection and AF rate control; will hold other anti-hypertensives for now

b.	Rhythm - unclear duration of Afib so immediate cardioversion not an option (avoid TEE in the setting of UGIB); lopressor for rate control; no anticoagulation for now; central telmetry

c.	Pump - no active issues 

3.	increased WBC 

a.	unclear etiology ? reactive

b.	Afebrile, no signs of infection; will follow

4.	diabetes

a.	SSI

  He missed his last appointment, but today he states that he has been feeling fine. He reports no chest pain, no dyspnea, no palpitations, no orthopnea, no PND. He is ambulating around the house without a problem. He has some occasional leg pains, but he now takes acetaminophen instead of nitroglycerin. He reports no recent ankle swelling, because he states that he elevates his legs.

Physical Exam

Blood pressure 124/70  

Pulse 68  irregular

Weight 136  

General appearance   Elderly man appears well

Neck   carotids 1+, JVP 8 cm, no nodes, thyroid non palpable

Selected recent labs

	

  EKG- AF at 68, new RBBB, LAH. 

CMP/CBC/HbA1C

Urine for albumin



Assessment and plan

	

  1. AF: recurrence of his AF, but no significant CHF and no symptoms to suggest active ischemia. He is already rate controlled on beta blocker. Decision to anti-coagulate is not easy. On one hand, he is a very functional man. On the other hand, he is 88, walks with a cane for balance, and is not very fond of frequent doctors visits. Discussed EKG findings and anticoagulation with Dr. Youmans, his cardiologist. Dr. Youmans will see patient next week. 

2. CAD/CHF: Stable- Continue ASA/BB/ACEI/statin. BP OK. 

3. DM: HbA1C normal on low dose glyburide. (+) microalb- on ACEI- check again today. 

4. PUD: no recent bleeding. No symptoms. 

5. HCM: Flushot 11/95. Declines c-scope (last 2087).

		RE: LEVI  WALTON

6/22/2096

Admission Note

Mr. Walton is an 88 year old man h/o AF, CAD, DM, who is admitted with dizziness and back pain after a fall. 



He was seen one week ago in clinic, and appeared medically stable. Gait was normal. He had a return of AF in March, but rate was controlled and there was no CHF. Evaluation with Dr. Youmans was planned this week for ? start anticoagulation. 



On Friday, June 19, he fell backwards in the kitchen while at the sink. He reports no headache, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or pain before the fall. He struck his head and back. No LOC. On Wednesday June 21, his family called to report he was unsteady and feeling dizzy. He was referred to the MCC ER. 



Of note, he had his usual chest pain, relieved with one SL TNG several times a week. He did take one SL TNG shortly before his fall. 



In ER, he was diagnosed with UTI and admitted for treatment and gait evaluation.

Chest CT: No acute displaced fracture or dislocation. Multiple large mediastinal lymph nodes, largest in right paratracheal region. Findings may be reactive. Follow up is recommended if clinically indicated. Pleural calcifications with associated nodules, also seen on prior examination. Findings likely represent asbestos exposure. 



Echo: moderate MR, EF 46%, inferoapical HK/AK, Elevated RVSP 88 



A/P: 

88 year old man s/p mechanical fall, perhaps some orthostasis due to NTG or postprandial state. He looks baseline. Testing has revealed a number of abnormalities but do not think this is directly related to presentation. 



1. s/p fall: evaluate with PT, check orthostatics after meal. Back pain likely muscular- no fracture- treat with low dose oxycodone 

2. UTI: on levofloxacin, await culture 

3. CAD/CHF: appears euvolemic, ruled out for MI. Resume outpatient lasix and ACEI if BP allows. Echo shows Inferoapical HK, and high RV pressures- ? volume overload, ? pulmonary disease. Will ask Dr. Youmans to advise on management. 

4. Chronic lacunar stroke: already on ASA/statin. 

5. Mediastinal adenopathy: no work up in hospital. 

6. DM: May continue oral agents, check FS glucose. 



He would like to go home ASAP- he is not interested in many tests, and goal will be to d/c home with services.

REASON FOR CONSULT: HCT drop, guaiac +


HPI:
89M admitted on 12/18 with hypotension and HCT drop.


The patient was admitted on Dec 13th and seen by Dr. Esposito from GI.  Per her note, he was admitted with ""complaints of vomiting up food and constant chest pain for 3-4 days. He reports that he has had some troubles with food for the past few months but can't define precisely what the troubles were. It seems that he intermittently vomited or regurgitated both liquids and solids and had a sensation of something getting stuck in his chest. Over the last 3-4 days everything he ate or drank, including water, would come up. He denies nausea. There is no abdominal pain but he describes a constant pain across his chest at the level of his nipples for the past 3-4 days. His pain is currently controlled. He denies pain on swallowing. He does report some weight loss but is unable to identify how much. He denies any new neurologic deficits or headaches.  A barium swallow was obtained which showed a fixed narrowing in the distal esophagus. He has a hx of gastric and duodenal ulcers on endoscopy from 2092 in the setting of NSAID use. He had a normal colonoscopy in 2087.""


During that admission. He underwent upper endoscopy that showed severe esophagitis. Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.  The duodenum was normal. He was discharged on December 15th with HCT 31.3.


The patient now returns with HCT drop to 19 and hypotension. He reports continued difficulty swallowing and some nausea, vomiting. ""Everything comes up."" He says this has been persistent since his discharge.  He also reports continued black stools since discharge as well. No clear BRBPR. His wife notes one episode of hematemesis yesterday.  No lightheadedness, dizziness, DOE, SOB.  In the ED, hypotensive to 60's / 70's SBP, HCT 19, his ABD CT was negative. INR  pending. He was started on pressors (levophed and vasopressin) and transferred to the MICU for ongoing care.


Currently the patient has no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or BRBPR.

STUDIES:
Dec 13th EGD
Impression: - LA Grade D esophagitis. It could represent 
reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagitis or 
underlying malignancy. Biopsied.
- Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.
- Normal examined duodenum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
89M with PMH gastric ulcers and severe esophagitis who returns with HCT drop.  In the setting of guaiac positive stool, he may have bleeding from his gastric ulcers or from the severe esophagitis that was seen endoscopically last week.  He may have a visible vessel at the ulcer site.  Alternatively, he may have a Mallory-Weiss Tear from the wretching due to persistent nausea and vomiting.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:


1. Please make Patient NPO
2. Please ensure two large bore IV's are in place
3. Active Type and Cross
4. HCT checks TID
5. IV PPI
6. Plan EGD today once resuscitated7.
7. Please check INR and reverse if needed. With an elevated lactate, he may be septic.




Thank you for allowing us to participate in this patient's care.  Please page with any additional questions.

(391) 643-6925                     03/09/2080




HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Potts is a 65-year-old male who comes in for followup of chronic kidney disease and other medical problems.
1.  Chronic kidney disease.  Creatinine stable at 1.42.  He is on no ACE inhibitor.
2.  Borderline diabetes mellitus.  He is not currently treated.  However, A1c recently 6.6.
3.  Low HDL.  Recent fasting lipid analysis showed total cholesterol 121, triglycerides 74, LDL 85, and HDL 21.
4.  History of prostate cancer.  PSA less than assay.


MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol q.i.d. p.r.n., atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily, diltiazem 180 mg p.o. daily, Flomax 0.8 mg daily, Flonase 2 sprays b.i.d., folic acid 2 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg p.o. daily, Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, and TriCor 200 mg p.o. daily.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Blood pressure 100/60, weight 226 pounds, heart rate 68 and regular.  Chest:  Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Extremities:  No edema.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Chronic kidney disease.  This remains stable.  However, he should be on an ACE inhibitor.  I will initiate lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, substituted for diltiazem.
2.  Borderline glucose tolerance.  The patient will return for 2 hour glucose tolerance test.
3.  Low HDL.  Remains quite low in the setting of coronary artery disease despite treatment.  We will continue TriCor.
4.  History of prostate cancer.  No evidence of recurrence.
5.  Hypertension.  Good control.  Substitute lisinopril for diltiazem as noted above.

Assessment and Plan	
1.  Health Maintenance - Pap smear  -will do every two to 3 years. mammo -still very overdue - stressed needs to do this again and promises,  colonoscopy fine  2071. To increase exercise.
2. Menopause - calcium, consider BD when not overwhelmed with everything else
3. Sleep, stress - seems to be doing generally better now.  Discussed this for most of her 45 minute appointment.  Starting to get out now and socialize.  To work quite regularly now.  Not interested in further counseling or medications.
4. sinus congestion states she wakes up and feels her sinuses are clogged her eyes are puffy and sneezing.  No help with Claritin.  Will try Flonase for two to 3 weeks to see if it helps.
  
Rest of issues - see above.

follow-up 3 months

RE:BRADY DUVALL

RAH#425 03 15 1

 

Dear Denny:

 

Just a note to tell you that I saw Brady Duvall again today for his 

congestive heart failure.  His clinical course is well known to you.  

He has had a slight increase in peripheral edema.  This has occurred 

despite a medical regimen that includes Lasix 40 mg daily, aldactone 25 

mg daily, Coumadin, atenolol 25 mg daily, amiodarone 200 mg daily, 

insulin, vancomycin that was recently discontinued, Zocor 80 mg daily, 

clonopin, Plavix, and glucophage.  He is also on captopril 6.25 mg po 

t.i.d.

 

From a functional point of view, he seems to be stable although, as 

noted, he has had a slight increase in peripheral edema.  His past 

clinical course is well known to you.  As you know, he had an 

epicardial abscess from electrode placement.  

 

From a clinical point of view, he is otherwise stable.

 

Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 193 pounds, blood 

pressure 120/60, with a resting pulse of 76.  Neck veins are distended, 

with positive hepatojugular reflux.  His carotid volume is diminished.  

His lungs are

generally clear, without rales or rhonchi.  Examination of the heart 

reveals a quiet precordium.  There is a soft S3 gallop, no murmur of 

mitral regurgitation, and no obvious murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.  

Abdomen is of note for a liver at the right costal margin.  There is +2 

peripheral edema.

 

The resting electrocardiogram shows paced rhythm.

 

We will be increasing his Lasix to 80 mg daily and following him 

closely by telephone over the next several days.  I have made no other 

changes in his current medical regimen.

 

Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.

 

With best regards.

 

Sincerely yours,

Assessment and Plan



Chest pressure and dyspnea. The patient has known coronary vasospastic events for which she has consulted with cardiology. The symptoms that she describes suggest possible symptomatic cardiac ischemia. She had a baseline ECG today in my office that was normal. I have instructed the patient to follow up with cardiology for further assessment and an ETT. I will communicate with Dr. Wright. The description of symptoms do not suggest unstable angina. 
Glucose intolerance with post prandial hyperglycemia. Continue metformin, well tolerated, HbA1c requested. 
Hyperlipidemia. On atorvastatin. Target LDL &lt;70, new values requested. 
Hypertension. Stable, continue current medications. 
Microscopic hematuria with negative work up. Surveillance UA and cytology requested. 
Rhinopharyngitis. Amoxicillin and fluticasone initiated. 
Gynecology contact information provided. 
Ophthalmology contact information provided. 
Bone densitometry requested. 
Labs requested. 
Follow up after tests or in 3-6 months.

   Cardiology Admission for Dr. Paulson

69 y.o. male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 presents today to ODC ED with progressively worsening shortness of breath and intermittent left jaw pain. 

The patient reports having undergone CABG in September 2092 at WMMC after developing jaw pain and shortness of breath. He was told at that time that there might be a problem with one of the grafts. Surgery otherwise uneventful. He was discharged home and developed recurrent symptoms. Cardiac catheterization was performed in early Jan 2093 at BS which, by his report, showed one occluded graft. He underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. Relook coronary angiography was performed about 2 weeks later showing no change. He saw Dr. Paulson for 2nd opinion about 2 months ago. His review of angio from Jan: SVG to mid RCA patent, LIMA to 2nd diagonal patent, SVG to LAD not seen and extensive LAD disease. LAD intramyocardial. LV function normal. Ranexa was added however he has not noted any improvement in jaw pain. He has progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent exertional left jaw pain partially relieved by 2 s.l. TNG. Despite greatly curtailing his activities, he is having daily symptoms. He has been enrolled at cardiac rehab but can only bicycle 2.8 mins. He phoned Dr. Paulson's office today and was advised to come to the ODC ED for evaluation.

In the ED, he appears comfortable and painfree. Did note some left jaw pain earlier. HR 73 SR, BP 122/71, O2 sat 98% RA. ECG showed NSR rate 71, incomplete RBBB with LAFB, LAE, TWI V1-V2-no important change c/w prior tracing 2/18/93. BNP, CK-MB, and TnT normal. CXR shows clear lungs.

In light of his history of CAD, CABG, prior PCI, and progressive symptoms, admitted for further evaluation.

Dear Margaret,



I had the pleasure of seeing this patient in the Cardiology Clinic at the Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital.  Since I last saw Ms. Law, she underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery, internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery, free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay.  Currently, she is doing some walking, but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned.  However, her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery.  She has some residual sternal wound pain, but it has improved since her discharge.



Current Medications:

1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.

2.  DuoNeb.

3.  Diltiazem 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.

4.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.

5.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily.

6.  Metolazone 2.5 mg daily.

7.  Toprol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.

9.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.

10.  Colace, ferrous sulfate, ibuprofen, senna.



Adverse Medication Reactions:

1.  Azithromycin.

2.  ACE inhibitor, cough.

3.  Latex, angioedema.



On physical examination, heart rate 81, blood pressure 106/75, and weight of 246.  In general, she is well appearing, in no apparent distress.  Jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.  Carotids are 2+, no bruits.  The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, a well-healed median sternotomy, regular rate and rhythm.  No significant murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses, bruits, organomegaly.  Extremities:  1-2+ edema.



Review of labs dated 05/28/2134, potassium 4.3, creatinine 0.9, ALT 16, AST 16, total cholesterol 125, triglycerides 106, HDL 36, and LDL 68.



In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman status post CABG, doing well.  She does appear to be mildly volume overloaded today, therefore I will make the following medication adjustments.  As far as her cardiac meds, they will change to aspirin 81 mg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol succinate 100 mg p.o. daily, and pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.



I will titrate her Lasix on an outpatient basis to have her lose 5-7 pounds to improve her shortness of breath as well as her edema.  We will ask VNA to draw labs as well.



I will see her again in 2 weeks' time.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.



Warmest regards,

Follow-up for labile hypertension.  At the time of our last visit, she 

began Procardia XL 30 mg daily and completed a series of 24 hour urine 

tests.  All of the urine tests returned normal.  After being on the dose 

of Procardia, she noticed some continuation of her symptoms and Dr. Iniguez 

suggested that she increase the dose to two tablets daily.  She has been 

on that dose for the last two weeks and has noticed dramatic change in 

her symptoms.  Shes having much fewer spells and her blood pressure, 

likewise is much lower than it had been.  Overall, she is pleased with 

these results.

 

Her other medications have remained the same although she has 

discontinued using immediate release Nifedipine and Nitroglycerin both 

sublingual and patches.

 

BP initially 142/52, later by me 170/68

Weight 155 lbs.

Pulse 68

Her examination remains unchanged except she has 2+ edema in her left 

leg and 1+ in the right leg.

 

Assessment:  Labile hypertension-clinically improved.

 

Plan:

 

1.  Change Procardia XL to 60 mg once daily and continue other 

medications as is.

2.  I suggested that she return for her regular follow-up with Dr. Gibbons 

and Dr. Iniguez.  I would be happy to see her in the future but do not 

feel that additional visits here are necessary.

ALGIERS MEDICAL CENTER



Nicholas Osuna M.D. 

Internal Medicine

Algiers Medical Center

,  



Dear Dr.  Osuna:



  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology for followup on coronary artery disease.  As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago and had stenting at that time and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has done well since that time without any exertional angina, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been followed here by Dr.  Opal Garner and has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm.  He underwent surgery for hip replacement of his left hip last summer and has recovered from that.  He did get on to about 220 pounds before the surgery, but has gained 20 pounds back and is now at about 240 pounds.  He says that most of this is because of inactivity.  He likes to work in his yard in Barnstable and plans to increase his activity and try and drop off some of that weight this summer.



Past medical history:

   Significant for diabetes, large anteroseptal myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, tubular adenoma of the colon, and diverticulitis.



Current Medications:

  Imdur 30 mg qd

 Lasix 10 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 lisinopril 40 mg qd

 Plavix 75 mg qd

 aspirin 325 mg qd

 Prilosec 20 mg qd

 Toprol XL 25 mg qd

 nitroglycerin PRN



Family history:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Social history:

   He is retired.  He lives in Barnstable.  He likes to work in his yard.  He quit smoking several years ago.



Review of systems:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-BP: 130/70  

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Mildly overweight

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes

-Cardiac:   Reveals a normal S1 and S2, with a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally



Procedures:

Echocardiogram test STATUS POST His last echo.  which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence.  There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.

Stress test STATUS POST at that time as well as  07/10/2080. He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate.  There was no evidence of ischemia.  There was evidence of a previous anteroapical, anteroseptal infarct.



EKG:

    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block, and a possible old IMI and old ASMI.



Selected recent labs:

 The patient's last blood work was 08/17/2080 and at that time his BUN was 9, creatinine 0.8, potassium was 3.8, blood glucose 145, cholesterol was 96, triglycerides 70, HDL 42, and LDL 40.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a big anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago.  He has had stenting of his coronaries in 2076.  He is without any evidence of ischemia at this time.  He has a fairly good LV function.  There is an LV aneurysm, but Coumadin has been deferred and he has been treated with aspirin and Plavix.  He is on a good medical regimen.  Blood pressure seems to be well controlled.  He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure.  He does have some trace pedal edema.  His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer.  I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today.  My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight.  Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.

Plastic Surgery     Consult Note
Patient:  Richard, Ulysses
MRN#:  8913196
Date of Consult:  7/26/78

Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg

HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.  He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.  He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot. There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78. He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well. The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.  No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.  During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.  The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.  The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.  He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft.  Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.

Vitals:  T: 96.9, HR: 75, BP: 179/78, RR: 18, O2 sat: 96% RA
Physical Examination:  
General: Alert, oriented, NAD, good historian
Lower extremities:  Multiple well-healed incisions.  On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.  It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.  The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.  The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.  No odor.  There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.  Distal pulses palpable. Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.  There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.  The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.

Relevant Laboratory Values:
Pending

Assessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.  This may be amenable to local flap coverage.

Recommendations: 
-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week
-Will discuss with Dr. Ring (covering for Dr. Velasco) and plan to assist with closure.
-Preoperative labs and studies pending.
-Continue daily dressing changes for now.

The patient was discussed with Dr. Uriah Wills.

	Interval History:
   Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit.  Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.  First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.  She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.  She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.  It gets better when she rests.  She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.  Her sugars are out of control.  Her weight is down, nonetheless.

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   80
-BP: 130/85  
-weight:   206 lbs.
-General:   Overweight.  Well appearing.
-Skin:   No rashes.  Anicteric.
-Heent:   Unremarkable.
-Neck:   JVP less than 5, possible venous hums bilaterally.  Carotids without bruits.
-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
-Cardiac:   Apical impulse nondisplaced and discrete.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and split S2.  Soft S4 gallop.
-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, dilated aorta.
-Extremities:   No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Procedures:
	
Electrocardiogram  normal sinus rhythm IVCD, old IMI.  In addition, she has nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared there is no important change.


	Impression:
   1.  Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs.  Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina.  I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this.  I will continue on the current medication program.
2.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is a bit elevated.  Given her diabetes, I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor.  Accordingly, lisinopril 2.5 mg QD was added to her program.
3.  Lipids will be checked.  I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed.  Our goal LDL in this case is less than 70 mg/dL.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Vance is a 45 year old woman with diabetes, 
porphyria and coronary artery disease, who came in today for annual visit.  
 
HPI:  
1.   Pain in right hand.  The patient has a Dupuytren's contraction in the 
     right hand.  She did have one in the left hand for which she had 
     surgery in June, 2064.  The surgery was performed by Dr. Peter 
     Vandenberg.  At that time, she also had an ulnar nerve decompression.  
     She had trigger fingers in the left index and ring finger as well, 
     which were repaired.  She is a Transport Operations Supervisor that uses her hands 
     extensively and is very concerned about the pain in her right hand.
2.   Diabetes mellitus.  She only rarely checks her blood sugars.  They 
     tend to run about 160.  She has had diabetes for 28 years.  She takes 
     NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m. and CGI 10 units sub q q.a.m.  She 
     is not on an evening dose.  Her last ophthalmology visit was in 6/66.  
     She denies any problems with peripheral neuropathy.  
3.   Coronary artery disease.  She is status post single vessel CABG in 
     9/61 for isolated lesion.  Since then she has had no angina.  She has 
     been on no medications for coronary artery disease since 2063.  
4.   Left breast lesion.  She was found to have a breast mass in 12/66 and 
     underwent wire localization and biopsy.  At that  time, she had micro 
     calcifications on her mammogram at that time.  The past report 
     revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia only.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m., CGI 10 units sub 
q q.a.m., Tylenol p.r.n., aspirin 85 mg PO q.d.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure 114/50.  Weight 111.5 lbs.  General 
appearance: healthy appearing middle aged woman in no acute distress.  
HEENT: no retinopathy was noted on my exam.  Neck: no thyromegaly.  Chest 
is clear to P&A.  She has sternotomy scars present.  Cardiac: normal S1, 
S2.  Breasts: right breast is normal, left breast reveals surgical 
incisional scars at 12:00 and 3:00 O'clock.  She does have a firm mass 
below the incisional scar at 3:00 P.M.  Abdomen: midline scar in the lower 
abdomen is evident from her C section.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  
Extremities: no edema.  Pelvic exam: external genitalia are normal.  
Vagina, cervix, fundus, adnexae all normal.
 
IMPRESSION: 
1.   Painful right hand.  The patient was referred back to Dr. Peter 
     Vandenberg for evaluation for surgery.
2.   Diabetes mellitus.  I asked the patient to keep track of her blood 
     sugars for then next month and to return to see me.  I also checked a 
     BUN and creatinine as well as a urine micro albumen.  We checked her 
     annual cholesterol.  Her previous cholesterol was done 5/66 and was 
     203.  She was referred to Dr. Nava for a good retinal exam.

                                              9-5-67
 
 
 
3.   Status post CABG.  I started her on atenolol 25 mg PO q.d. given that 
     she does have coronary artery disease, and there is a question as to 
     whether or not she had an MI in 2061, which she will return in one 
     month for blood pressure check and also to review her blood sugars.

Dear Wanda:

Mr. Vance returns for followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression.  She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria.  Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted.  After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline.  Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10.  As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.

Currently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous. q.p.m., Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o. q.d., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n. which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d., and p.r.n. Motrin.

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 105/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.

Electrocardiogram is pending.

Impression:  Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective.  However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function.  She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease.  Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen.  Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.  I have not further altered her medical regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

Sincerely yours,

Nathan J Fernandes M.D. 



College Station, NC 22169



Dear Dr. Fernandes:



  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.  It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.  As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.  Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.  When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.  At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.  Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.  Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.  Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.  He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.  He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.



From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.  We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.

glyburide 

Lipitor  80 mg qd

Lopid  600 mg BID

Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress

-Heent:   Benign

-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs

-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.  S1 and S2.  There is no murmur, rub, or gallop

-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.  There are no masses or bruits appreciated

-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.  Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.  Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration

-BP: 145/80    on the right



	Other Data:

   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.

Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.

Hypospadias repair in childhood.



	Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.



Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.  Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.  On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.  We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.  Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.  Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.



It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.  Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.  We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.  He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.  He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.  With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.



Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.  We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

I saw this patient and personally obtained the history of present illness.  I also reviewed and confirmed the PMH, medications, social and family history, and detailed ROS. I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination, including assessment of VS; auscultation of carotid arteries, lungs, heart, and abdomen; palpation of carotid arteries, evaluation of jugular venous pressure, palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion, and neurologic examination for focal deficits.  I interpreted the EKG and other pertinent laboratory data.  I discussed findings with the patient and personally developed the management strategy and plans.  My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above, with which I concur.  Guy Nunes M.D.

Dear Dr. Cooper:

  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christian Mullen today in the office in followup for his peripheral artery disease, as well as his coronary disease.  I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.

Regarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago.  This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf.  The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset.  They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat.  While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living.  He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively.  The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.  As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight. He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet.  He is struggling with the decision.

I would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.

In terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler.  Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill.  He has no ulcers or gangrene.

From a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well.  He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs.  It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia.  While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease.  He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results.

Otherwise, Chris is doing great.  We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.  We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.  If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation.  Otherwise, as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited, we will continue the same.


	Other Data:
   I saw him today with Vernon Galvan, one of my cardiovascular fellows, who have written a detailed note. We will send this along to you as well.

Thanks again.

Best personal regards,

RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.

Dear Dr. Cooper:

  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes. 
As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history. He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093. He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries. As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.

He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA. He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.

Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.


He returns today for review. He remains in reasonable health. He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery. He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side. He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina. However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study. He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.



	Past medical history:
   CAD 
-- 2082 CABG x 3 
-- 10/9/91 LIMA to LAD patent; mod LAD stenosis beyond graft; SVT to OM patent; SVG to RCA occl @ origin 
-- 10/91 rota-stenting of mid RCA 99% --&gt; 0% 
Hypertension. 
Hyperlipidemia. 
PAD 
-- 11/88 left common femoral and left popliteal artery revasc; stent Medtronic bridge Assurant ot left common iliac art 
-- 2/89 right external and internal and right common femoral artery revasc; stent to right common femoral art 
Obesity. 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (2/2089 HgbA1c -- 6.50) 
Depressive disorder, none x 20 years, no hospitalization or harm to self 
Cervical spine disease s/p C6-C7 disk surgery 2079 
Congenital hypospadias. 
Prostatitis- since age 30, takes antibiotic daily. 
Hemorrhoids. 
Colonic polyps. 
Chronic normocytic anemia.

Medications: 
EcASA 325 mg daily 
NPH 68 u qpm about 9pm

	Changes to Allergies
	
Fentanyl - reaction: see comment (nausea and vomiting during 11/23/2088 catheterization) [reviewed]
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: see comment (No known allergies to shellfish, iodine, or contrast media) [reviewed]
Penicillins - reaction: Rash [reviewed]


	Family history:
   Positive for CVD and DM.



	Social history:
   Married, glazier, 3 grown adult children 
Tob: quit 2071 smoked 3 packs of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years 
Exercise: Negative for any regular exercise b/c of claudication 
ETOH: 1 beer a week 
Negative for illicit drug use. 


Physical examination:
	
-Pulse: 77  
-General:   No acute distress.
-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.
-Heent:   Unremarkable
-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.
-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.
-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.
-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses with bruits. Doppler + right DP/ PT biphasic signal, doppler (+) left DP/PT monophasic signal
-BP: 130/60  Bilaterally


	EKG:
   NSR (73), normal axis, IVCD, no acute ischemic changes.


	Impression:
   Mr Mullen is a 74 year old gentleman with extensive PAD andCAD now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication. He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia. Finally, he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids.


	Assessment and plan:
   1. CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test.

2. PAD- worsening claudication, will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene.

3. Carotid disease; currently asymptomatic, will repeat CANIs.

I saw this patient and confirmed the history of present illness, PMH, medications, and ROS. I also confirmed the cardiovascular examination and interpreted the pertinent laboratory data.  I discussed findings with the patient and developed the management strategy.  My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.  Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG. He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors. but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.  Rutherford 2.  Disabling. Has signif disease previously treated. Will review films and consider repeat CTA to decide whether he warrants relook and repeat intervention. He is s/p CFA/Profunda endarterectomy.3) Weight - will provide him names of Bariatric surgeons here at BMH.4) Carotids - asymptomatic. repeating CNI's

    She presents stating that she is getting along reasonably well. Her main problem is burning in her legs and feet, also present in her hands. She also reports an increased frequency of her chest tightness, occuring mainly at night, sometimes before going to sleep, sometimes durign the night. This is responsive to 1 SL TNG typically, although sometimes is goes away without intervention. She denies SOB, PND, orthopnea, presycope or syncope. She has intermittant mild LE edema. She occasionally has palpitations, lasting ~ 5 minutes, resolving spontaneously. She cannot relate them to any time of day or activity, and they are not associated w/ lightheadedness or CP.

      Assessment and plan:
    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG. Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI). A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.


Problems:
      


Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief. Takes it about once/month. These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.  Her echo showed preserved LV function and no significnat valvular disease.  A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%. I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.


      


Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal! I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.  Continue her present dose of statin.


      


HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today. Continue her current regimen.

HPI: Asked to see patient by surgical team in consultation for is multiple medical issues. I have served as his PCP for eight years. Pt seen and examined. Case discussed in detail . This is a 62 y/o male with multiple medical issues last admitted in September for increased falls, found to have a small stroke in addition to his likely vascular dementia. Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer/ S/P debridement and later TMA. He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow-up. At baseline, patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy, has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25% compliance. At the time of his last admission, he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement.


The patient's wound has currently not been closed. He has a vac dressing in place. He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology. Current hospital course has been complicated by increased agitation and last evening, self limited substernal chest pain and dyspnea. This resolved spontaneously. He has also been intermittently refusing his medications and has been attempting to ambulate.


This AM.  the patient actually denies ever experiencing chest pain. He also only recalls his foot pain with repeated prompting. He denies any pain, dyspnea

EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.


Assessment/Plan
 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes. Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial. S/P Rt TMA. Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.


By issue:


1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance. The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management. If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option. In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.


Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx. I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.  If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.


2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start. He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes. Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx. Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior. Might hold ranitidine as well.  Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc. Currently on olanzapine. Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged. Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.


3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound. Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status. All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative. Would seek ID input to the end. Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future. 
4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today . Recs per nephrology
3) DM: HgA1c was at target. Please cover as needed with RISS for now. 5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time. Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP. Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
 Thanks,

RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.  Currently, she
complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest
discomfort.  In addition, she states that she has no energy and
worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned.  She
reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest
discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.  
 
She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64
units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH
sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., Captopril 25 mg
po t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d.,
amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., Neurontin 900 mg po t.i.d., atenolol 50 mg
po q.d., estrogen 0.05 topically q three days and a nitropatch .2
mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over 
twenty-four hour period.
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress. 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,
respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.  The neck is
supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. 
Chest is completely clear.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,
physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur
radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic
murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees.  There are mild diffuse
nonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as evidence for left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Compared to her last electrocardiogram,
her heart rate is slower and her ST-T wave changes are less

Olivier, Christine
MR #652-33-21-5               -2-            December 05, 2074
 
Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her 
multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.  Currently it is not
clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,
however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test
(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.  In addition, I
will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated
hemoglobin.  It is certainly possible that her fatigue and
generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause. 
Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her
present regimen.  She will contact you or myself should her chest
pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.  
 
Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Sincerely yours,

Team B Intern Admission Note



Name: French, Xue  

MRN:  875-10-45	 

Date of Admission: 12-Dec-2091   

PCP:   Dr. John Hood (Resident - PVH Isabela Healthcare Center)

Other PVH providers:   Dr. Raymond Xie - Rheum 

Admitting Intern: Olivia H. Grant, MD

Team:   B



CC:   Pt is a 59 year old female with h/o SLE, interstitial nephritis, GERD, h/o positive stress s/p RCA angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain.





HPI: Pt initially presented to her PCP on day of admission with a complaint of 2 weeks of intermittent chest pain. Pt reported that pain has been lasting anywhere from 20 min to 1 hour and that it emanates from the L sternal border with radiation to L lateral thorax and radiation to L arm, accompanied by tingling/numbness in L digits + occasionally right digits, as well as down the L leg. In PVH ED, pt describes the pain as    like a bleeding scar    and states    my heart is bloated    through her daughter who acted as her interpreter.  She reports that the pain, at it's worst is 5/10, but has improved to 2/10 after NTG en route to the ED and once in the ED.  She affirms nausea and diaphoresis accompany pain. Pain has no relationship to position or activity -- has occurred during sitting, ambulation, and reclining. Pt lives on the second story of her building and has noted that walking up stairs has been been more difficult over the past two weeks secondary to calf and ankle pain, L > R, follow by chest pain.  Pt has not had to use more pillows in the past two weeks when sleeping, and reports no change in the number of times per week that she wakes up short of breath, which varies between one to two times per week.  Pt denies increased swelling in extremities over the past two weeks or increase in weight.

Radiology:

Dissection Protocol CT of 12-Dec-2091: reveals no evidence of aortic dissection. Complex cyst within the spleen. Uterine fibroids.  Degenerative disc disease.



CXR of 12-Dec-2091: The lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The bones are unremarkable.





EKG:   

12-Dec-2091: Sinus brady with a rate of approximately 50.  Normal axis.  Normal intervals.  No ST elevations or depressions.  Q waves in leads II, III and AVF c/w prior inferior infarct.  Q waves in V5, V6.  Good R wave progression.  No atrial or ventricular enlargement noted.  No change from prior ECG's. 



Adenosine MIBI 6/20/2089: 

 The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  negative for

 ischemia. The myocardial perfusion scans show a small size, mild

 intensity, primarily fixed inferolateral defect consistent with

 prior infarct with substantial residual viable myocardium but only

 minimal stress induced ischemia. Compared to the study of 01/26 with

 treadmill exercise (RPP ~24K) the previously noted anterior wall

 defect is less apparent in the present exam.



CARDIAC CATH OF 12/09/2082:

Successful PTCA of the mid RCA with a 3.0 mm balloon with 20 to 30 per cent residual plaque and a hazzines consistent with possible small dissection.



Pt referred by Dr. YARBROUGH, underwent catheterization for

unstable angina, a positive exercise text and recent myocardial infarction.



PROCEDURE

PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY was performed on the Mid RCA using a maximum balloon size of 3.0 mm advanced through a 9YS7EZ guiding catheter.





Assessment:  Pt is a 59 year old female with h/o SLE, interstitial nephritis, GERD, h/o positive stress s/p RCA angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain reproducible upon palpation who is admitted to rule out MI with one set of negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.



Plan:

1.	Chest Pain: Likely musculoskeletal in nature given reproducibility of pain on palpation.  However, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers.  Adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well.  Pt's Atenenlol switched to Lopressor during admission.  Pt Dilatrate-SR changed to Isordil.    Continuing home meds of Nifedipine and ASA.  Pt to be NPO after midnight for am cardiac testing.



2.	SLE: Continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as Vitamins C and D.  Will notify Dr. Xie that pt is in-house per request of PCP, to determine if any further Rheum w/u is necessary.



3.	GI: Will repeat amylase and lipase.  Prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin. although unlikely as elevation is minimal.

Assessment and Plan

1. Odynophagia/hoarseness/swelling.

Constellation of symptoms concerning for mass effect involving soft tissue. Ordering neck CT I+ to examine for infiltrating process.

If unrevealing would proceed to barium swallow to evaluate odynophagia and hoarseness. 

She will continue current diet as sx do not interfere with consumption.

2. HTN.

Chronic problem. I discontinued isordil recently.

Can increase lisinopril to 10 this visit and titrate thereafter.

I would favor addition of diuretic, HCTZ, for additional management and anticipate BP mgmt will require further polypharmacy.

She is returning on 2/2/93 and will have NP visit.

3. Musculoskeletal pain/deconditioning.

RLE radiculopathy has resolved fairly spontaneously, as did the contralateral presentation, without intervention. She needs to recondition, increase range of motion and physical capacity in order to improve stamina and strength.

She has opted not to follow through with PT.

4. CAD.

Cont ASA, statin, BB, ACE.

5. DM.

Cont glipizide; continue ACE I as above. 

BG 125 today.

6. Lupus nephritis.

Cr stable. 

She has asked me to renew immunomodulatory agents but I would like to defer to rheumatology service.

7. HCM.

Stable. 

Requesting female provider to perform breast/pap. Scheduled for 2/2/93.

Attending note:

Pt discussed with Dr Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan. 

Neck Sx as described. I don't feel a mass or adenopathy, but worth further evaluation with CT, barium swallow if sx persist. BP needs better control, goal 130/80, addition diuretic and increase in ACE-I appropriate.

MOUNTAIN SIDE INTERN ACCEPT NOTE

Patient:  Isenberg, Michael
MRN:  3674193
Date of Admission:  25-March-2064
PCP:  Dr. Charles Uher (DSH)
Attending:  Julian Quintela/Micheal Leyva
 
CC:  Chest pain

HPI:For full details, please see SDU Admission Note of 3/22/64 and SDU transfer note of 3/25/64.  In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%.  His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation.  He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun.  Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats.  His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.
	On the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.  Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-T of 3.73 but with a CK of 133 (303) and CK-MB of 5.2 (16.2).  

Past Medical History:

RE:  Danny Nielson

MAH#:  



Dear Dr. Lopez:



Thanks very much for referring Mr. Nielson to see me for evaluation of his lymphadenopathy.  I will review his history for you.  Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg.  About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana.  At that point, a CT scan was performed.  CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen.  CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.  The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  



Wegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.  The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis.  This recurred in 2093.  He has been treated intermittently with low-dose azathioprine and steroids.  He is currently on a minimal dose of steroids.

He has grandchildren, four boys and four girls.  The patient was the long time Chief of Security for Cisco.  This job is currently held by his son.  He smoked about a pack a day from age 14 to age 50 quitting about 26 years ago.  Did drink significantly in the past, but usually only on the weekends, but did not drink everyday.



FAMILY HISTORY:  



The patient s father had colon cancer, which was apparently cured and died at age 87 of old age.  The patient s mother had breast cancer, which was cured and died at age 89 of old age.  The patient s brother had some sort of new cancer in his armpit; the exact histology is unknown.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  



Weight of 268 pounds, temperature of 97.5, blood pressure of 140/82, pulse of 84 and respiratory rate of 20.  General:  A well-appearing, well-developed gentleman in no apparent distress accompanied by his son today.  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic, thinning head of grey hair.  Pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx is moist.  No mucositis, pharyngitis, thrush or increased lymphoid tissue is seen.  The patient has a scar in the inside of his left buccal mucosa.  He has numerous actinic keratoses over his scalp and behind his left ear.  Otherwise, skin reveals no jaundice, rash or suspicious lesions.  Tongue is midline and well papillated.  The patient has a hearing aid in his right ear.  Neck is supple and somewhat full.  No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly is visible.  Lungs:  Slightly decreased breath sounds throughout and clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Back:  No costovertebral angle or vertebral body tenderness.  There is a very old healed scar in the left posterior flank consistent with prior nephrectomy.  Heart:  Soft systolic ejection murmur, no gallops or rubs, intermittent skipped beats, otherwise regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal.  Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable.  Extremities:  2+ edema on the right and 3+ on the left, pitting.  Lymph node exam:  No anterior or posterior auricular, no anterior or posterior cervical, no submandibular, submental, infraclavicular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

Neurologic exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact to specific examination.  Strength 5-/5, bilateral grip, bicep, triceps, deltoids, knee flexion and extension.  Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.



LABORATORY STUDIES:  



Recent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11.  Liver function tests are within normal limits.  Hemoglobin A1c is 6.  White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.



IMAGING STUDIES:  



The patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.  To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



1.  Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.  This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.  I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.  I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.  This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.  These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.  I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.  The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.  However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.  I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.  However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.  I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.

2.  Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.  If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.  He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.  The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.  In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.  At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.  At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.  The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.



Sincerely,







Gene Quadri, M.D.

Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D. 

 
DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.  
 
HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.  The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand.  This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.  Also bothers him during prolonged activity.  He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.  Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.  He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.   
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.  
 
ALLERGIES:  None.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.  
Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.  There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
very weak opponens.  He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.  His interossei and extensors are full.  Sensation is intact throughout.  
 
EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.   
IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.  At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.  We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.  We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.  We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

	Family history:

   Noncontributory.



	Social history:

   He has four children and 10 grandchildren.  He just returned to Tunisia to visit family.  He does not smoke.  Minimal alcohol.  His wife recently had quite a bad fall.



	Review of systems:

   Weight is stable.  No GI problems.  Otherwise negative.



Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   60

-BP: 145/70    140-145/70

-resp. rate:   16

-General:   He looks great

-Neck:   The jugular venous pressure was less than 5.  No carotid bruits.  No palpable lymph nodes

-Chest:   The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation

-Cardiac:   Showed an S4.  Normal S1.  No murmurs

-Abdomen:   Liver and spleen are not enlarged

-Extremities:   Good femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses



	EKG:

    shows first-degree AV bock and minor ST and T changes.  No change from July 2075.



	Assessment and plan:

   Mr.  Lilly is generally doing well.  His blood pressure is a little higher than it usually is in the office today, and we probably should have him on ACE inhibitor with his mild diabetes.  On the other hand, he is a little worked up over his wife's injury, and we will monitor his pressure.  For now, we will sit tight.  He will have a full battery of chemistries tomorrow-he sees Dr.  Mccullough, so far so good with respect to his cardiac sinus.  



Plan: Monitor blood pressure.  Low threshold for starting an ACE inhibitor.  Chemistries tomorrow.  See again in six months.

Reason for Visit:  moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Stage IVB 





Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 

Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 



History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia about 4 weeks ago.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 



He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well.



 

Problems/PMH:

Repair of Zenker's diverticulum in 2080

Aterial stent was placed in the mid LAD in 4/80

Hypercholesteremia

Arthritis

Borderline Diabetic

Heart murmur for 50 years



FH/SH:

Assessment and Plan:



72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer. He is doing quite well. Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss. After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging. If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment. If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards. He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.



RTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.

HPI

51 yo F with MMP comes to establish primary care as she is unhappy with the cre she is geting at CityMemorial. She was 40 mislate to her appt and time was limited. She has multiple medical problems for which she is on a variety of medications, none o which she has taken x1 month as she ran out of refills.



1. CVA-She reports 3-4 mos ago she had a stroke (she was told there was a clot in her brain) which left the L side of her face paralyzed and some residual weakness in her LUE. She also notes her handwriting has completely changed since. Since the stroke she has had multiple episodes during which her tongue becomes very heavy and she has difficulty speaking (distinctly different from her now mildly imapired baseline) At these times she feel somewhat confused and her L vison seems blurry. This has happened 4-5 times and lasts all day. er family has encouraged her to seek medical care but she has refused bc she did not think they would do antyhing for her. Of note, pt has not been on ASA as it was d/cd when she changed to celebrex. Pt also c/o memory loss that started even before the CVA.



2. CAD-She reports a h/o multiple MIs, incl cardiac cath x2, unknown if she had intevention, she thinks the last was about 1 yr ago. She has stable 3 pillow orthopnea. She becomes SOB when she climbs 5 steps and gets SOB sometimes when she walks, which resolves ith rest, but she is able to walk a fair amt still (cannot pin down how much).  She denies CP with exertion, did have CP with her MIs. She says smx she has lower and upper extremity edema. She has not had a recent ETT.



3. DM-Pt has been on glucophage and Humulin 70/30 100U in am and 60 in pm, but has not been monitoring her BS or taking insulin for the past month. She has all the necessary equipment. She says she tries o monior her carb intake. She has been gaining weight, bout 5 lbs in the past 2 mos, and notes polydypsia and polyuria fo the past 2 weeks.



4. HTN-has not been taking Zestoretic or Atenolol x1 mo



5. Depression-Pt has h/o depression for which she has been medicated in the past. She currently feels she has very depressed mood, apathy, trouble sleeping and with memory tasks. She denies SI/HI/AH.



6. In terms of health maintenance, her last PAP was 2 yrs ago as was her last Mammo. Her last HgA1C is fr 199 as are her lipids.

RE:  I had the pleasure of seeing Verna Cantu in consultation today for management of coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.

Dear Dr. Levon Nichols,

  She is a very pleasant 60 year old female with cardiovascular risk factors of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and prior tobacco abuse. She has no prior history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. About 15 years ago she underwent an ETT for evaluation of exertional lightheadedness which by her reports was unremarkable. 
She has an extensive vascular history s/p right popliteal PTA/Stent and left common femoral endarterectomy for which she has been receiving regular care from Dr. Nichols. She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson. 

She reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home. She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top. She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness. She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. Currently she reports no symptoms of claudication. No regular exercise. A couple of times a day. Bowls on Sunday night with no shortness of breath. She has also been noted to have a systolic murmur on previous exams. An echocardiogram in 2094 revealed aortic valve leaflet thickening but did not report significant aortic stenosis, though this was a technically difficult study by report. 

For evaluation of these symptoms she underwent an ETT-MIBI which was notable for poor exercise capacity, drop in blood pressure, exercise induced LBBB, and perfusion abnormality suggesting distal LAD territory ischemia. 



	Past medical history:
   1. Diabetes Mellitus: On oral medications for 7 years +Retinopathy both eyes ~ 7 yrs ago, no nephropathy. +neuropathy 
2. Hypertension controlled on medication ~ 5yrs, requiring frequent adjustments of meds, 140/70 
3. Peripheral arterial disease. Status post left common femoral endarterectomy by Dr. Vanover 11/26/95. 
4. Carotid artery disease. Mild bilateral internal carotid artery stenoses duplex ultrasound 6/96. 
5. Mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's. Followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson. In 2094 was having leg pains. 
6. Melanoma involving right thigh. s/p surgical resection 20 years ago 
7. Arthritis primarily of hands 

Prior surgeries: tonsillectomy, melanoma resection.

History of Presenting Illness
Mrs. Cantu is a 60 year old female with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

For the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion, especially with a flight of stairs. She must stop at the top to rest. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, or lower extremity edema. A recent echocardiogram in February revealed an ejection fraction of 71%, mild mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45mmHg, mean of 29mmHg, and a valve area of 0.8 sq cm. There are no wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle. A stress test in February revealed a reduced exercise capacity with a small area of mild apical ischemia and ejection fraction of 77%. A cardiac catheterization on 3/8 revealed 50% left main stenosis, 40-50% left anterior descending, 30% circumflex and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. Aortic valve area was noted at 0.98 sq cm. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed bilateral 20-49% stenosis.

She was referred to Dr. Gonzalez for an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She presents today for preoperative testing and evaluation. She currently notes dyspnea on exertion with two flights of stairs. She denies chest pain, dizziness, or diaphoresis.

Re:  Verna Cantu
ESH #:033-98-74


I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.  

As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.  We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.  

She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.  She is walking each day.  Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.  She has no complaints of pain.  She is eating well.  She is sleeping well.  Her incisions have healed nicely.  Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.  I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.

Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.

Rheumatology Visit
CANTU, VERNA L                        
MRN:  0261948

Date of Visit:  01/26/2098



Background:

Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease. She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain. Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration. She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70. Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face. The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095. Slowly these lesions healed. 


Interim Issues:
The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled. But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis. In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed. Recovering from surgery has been slow. But it has been steady and uncomplicated. She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home. She has had no recurrent chest pain. She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage. She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se. She healed well postoperatively. She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape. Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR. 



In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's. She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands. What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis. She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily. She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily. She has had no worsening swallowing.  She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion. She sleeps on two pillows. She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth. She continues on omeprazole. Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative. 


MEDS:
Amlodipine 5 MG QD 
Aspirin  325 MG QD  
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD 
Lisinopril 2.5 MG QD 
Metformin 500 MG BID 
Metoprolol Succinate Extended Release 25 MG QD 
Plaquenil  200 MG  QD 
Simvastatin 20 MG  QHS



FH/SH: She comes in with her husband, who feels she is doing very well and is delighted to see her better. Ms. Cantu went back to work 3 months after surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
BP 132/71, P 86, RR 16, Temp 97.7 F, Wt 132 lb
O2 SAT 98
PAIN LEVEL (0-10) 0
She has telangiectasias over her face. She looks well to me. Her color is good and she smiles easily. She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes. Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here. Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well. But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma. The midline scar has healed beautifully. The respiratory excursions appear full. There is no splinting. There are some bilateral crackles. Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease. There are no nail bed infarcts. There is some peripheral pitting of digits. Her feet are well healed, warm and well perfused. Her joints are benign today with no active synovitis. Heart: S1, S2 with a soft crisp, S2 noted. No insufficiency murmurs. 



IMPRESSION: 

MCTD/Raynaud's.
Sjogren's

ASCVD with aortic valve replacement 4/2097. 

PVD. 


PLAN

Education regarding the importance of protection re: trauma to finger tips and prevention of Raynaud's. 
Continue Prilosec, refill Plaquenil
Prescribe prednisone 5 mg p.r.n. arthritis. I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks. 


Her labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained. 


I will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim. 
Interview time 45 minutes due to medical history review, questions and verification of medications with the patient. 


She and her husband agree with this plan.

NEUROCRITICAL RESIDENT ADMIT NOTE

Name: Ollivo, Kimberly

MRN: 3299811

Date: 6/29/97

Time of Exam: 5:20 p.m.

NICU day: 1




Critically ill secondary to: 
R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration

Critical Care Min: 35 min




History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness. BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived. Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.  Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm 
and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.  She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.  CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.  She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management. 



At baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.  She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.  



PMHx: DM, HTN, dementia, h/o sz d/o not on AED now, Pituitary adenoma, s/p hypophysectomy, hypothyroidism, COPD, dyslipidemia, obesity, fatty liver, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, anxiety, meningitis, Rt humerus fx/osteo/nonunion, Cirrhosis or unclear etiology with hyperammonemia, Neuropathy with paresthesias, presumably due to diabetes



Home meds: Mirtazapine 15 mg daily, Namenda 10 mg daily, Potassium supplementation 20 meq daily, Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, Metoprolol (unclear if metoprolol succinate or tartrate) 25 mg daily, Prednisone 2.5 mg daily, MVI



All: Morphine ( Unknown ) Codeine ( Unknown ) ACE Inhibitor ( Unknown ) LISINOPRIL (cough ) CIPROFLOXACIN HCL (dec effects of sz med ) ATORVASTATIN (abnormal LFT )



SH: Lives with her son in Ardmore. Has two sons and a daughter. Daughter, Yolanda, is the HCP (817-638-1328) and primary caregiver.  She quit smoking 16 years ago.

Imaging/Studies/TCD: 

Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.  CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.





Assessment: 
Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift. The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly. A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI. Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities.

The patient was interviewed and examined by me as well as by the 

resident.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  In brief, this is a 64-year-old 

gentleman with morbid obesity.  He is on CPAP.  He has CHF, 

hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, triple bypass, and 

diabetes.  He had three episodes of chest pain which woke him up 

from CPAP last last night.  Each episode reminded him of his 

typical angina, but the last time he had it was in May.  Those 

three episodes were resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.  He 

woke up today and thought he needed to be evaluated.  He is also 

complaining of low grade temperature.  He has recently been 

receiving VNA services as a result of a left foot ulcer as a result 

of an oxygen tank burn.  His VNA came to visit him today and found 

that he had some crackles in his lungs with a temperature and was 

concerned about a pneumonia.  Please see the resident's note for 

details. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain now.  No shortness of 

breath now.  He states that his foot appears to be getting better.

MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, aspirin, isosorbide, Lasix, Glyburide, 

Lipitor, and Lorazepam.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient is a 

morbidly obese gentleman.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.2, pulse 

62, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 173/74.  O2 saturation is 

99%.  LUNGS:  He has rales at the right base.  Unable to assess 

JVD.  ABDOMEN:  He is obese with active bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES: 

Distal left foot lateral ulcer is dry, necrotic, without 

surrounding edema or tenderness.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His white count here is 14.  His BUN and 

creatinine are 25 and 2.4, which is his baseline.  CK is 28, 

troponin pending.  INR is 1.2.  EKG shows no changes from prior.  

Chest x-ray shows right pleural effusion with question right 

paratracheal mass.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  His care was discussed with the 

Christus Spohn cardiology.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina pectoris.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is going to 

be treated with antibiotics, aspirin, Lopressor, and admitted to 

the hospital for a rule out.  Condition on admission is stable.  He 

will be presumptively treated for a pneumonia on the right side.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

I confirm that I have seen and evaluated this patient, reviewed

the resident's documentation, discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old gentleman with

a history of coronary artery disease who is transferred here from

an outlying institution after an episode of left chest radiated

to his arm that awoke him from sleep at about 11 o'clock.  This

resolved after some sublingual nitroglycerin at the hospital but

was associated with some diaphoresis.  He cannot tell if it is

like his previous coronary pain or not.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

abdominal pain, fever, or chills.  Otherwise, negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL, AND FAMILY

HISTORY:  As per the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Shows a well-developed morbidly obese

gentleman snoring in the bed in no acute distress.  He is

asymptomatic when I see him and complaining of being tired. 

HEENT is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx is unremarkable. 

Neck is supple.  Chest is clear.  Abdomen is morbidly obese,

soft, and nontender.  Extremities are without cyanosis, clubbing,

or edema.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient has an EKG, an abnormal

but unchanged in comparison with previously.  He had a total

troponin here of 0.99 equal to the 0.1 at the outlying

institution.  His MB is 8 with a CK of 242.  His creatinine is

also 4.5.

PLAN:  Admission to the hospital for further evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Non-Q-wave, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

1.  He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.  These are 
improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
ranging from 150 to 190.  He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.  He has not had any 
further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
seems to be sticking more to the diet.  He has however gained some 
weight, which is a little disconcerting.  He does attend a podiatrist 
and is doing well from that perspective.  He is to return to the 
ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.  He 
missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
follow-up with nutrition at this time.
2.  Cardiovascular.  He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.  Further question regarding his stroke back 
in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
to have a hole in his heart at that time.  He was eventually stopped off 
Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
put on Coumadin for life at that point.  He had an aborted myocardial 
infarction in 2067.  He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
yards before getting very short of breath.  He has no orthopnea or PND.  
He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
3.  Health maintenance.  We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.  He 
has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
checked on the day prior to the test.  This will be scheduled by our 
secretary.  He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
standard dose and titrate up slowly.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.  He is tachycardic 
at 98 beats per minute.  Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
sided cataract.  Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.  The 
abdominal examination is also normal.  His injection sites were clean 
and without erythema.  There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
his feet appeared well.

We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.

PLAN:
1.  Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
2.  I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
left the other doses as is.
3.  I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
4.  We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
5.  I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
above for colorectal cancer screening.
6.  Return to see in a week's time, understands.  He can discuss any 
management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.

 Impression: 65 year old gentleman with multiple stroke risk factors, onset of dysarthria, aphasia, dizziness, ataxia at 13:00 today. Symptoms improving over first 30-60 minutes, but residual RUE drift, dysarthria, and (initally) upgoing R toe. Suspicious for L MCA cortical event. L ICA stenosis and/or embolic event +/- fetal left PCA possible concerns (?cortical vs v-b etiology of dizziness). Cannot obtain CTA secondary to elevated creatinine.  



Plan:  

1.	Admit to RDA 

2.	MRI/MRA. MR Perfusion study if L ICA stenosis or suggestion of intracranial stenosis. 

3.	As event occurred on ASA, provide heparin PTT 60-80, continue ASA at decreased dose (81 qD). Watch platelets, as pt starting with platelets =  150

4.	Hold antihypertensive, but continue isosorbide for known cardiac ischemic history. 

5.	Echo, Holter (for known bradycardia; eval for events with HR <<40. 

6.	PT/speech therapy. 

7.	Careful glycemic control (holding metformin).

EDVISIT^29964344^WHITAKER, VINCENT^08/11/97^TRAN, FREDDY

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient and the resident, Dr. Nieto.  Please see her note for

full details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old

gentleman with significant past medical history of hypertension;

diabetes; AFib; CHF; chronic renal insufficiency; end-stage renal

disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday; history

of PE and cardiac arrest as well as bacteremia who presents with

cough, weakness, chest pain, and palpitations.  At dialysis he

was found coughing and was sent here via ambulance.  He notes

decreased appetite.  He denies any fevers.  He has noted some

chills, some sweats, and some shortness of breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is slow.  Temperature 95.9, pulse 89,

respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 180/71, and saturation is 95%

on 2 liters.  He looks dyspneic, dehydrated with neck that is

supple.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Heart is regular

without a murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended. 

Skin is intact.  He has 2+ pedal edema.  He appears to be

lethargic but no focal neurologically.

LABORATORY DATA:  Review of his blood work shows a BUN of 31,

creatinine of 6.07, sodium of 139, potassium of 5.6 and

bicarbonate of 32.  LFTs are normal.  Lipase is 63.  BNP is 501. 

Lactic acid is 3.  Troponin is 0.04.  White count 5, hematocrit

42, and INR 2.  Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly, no acute

pneumonia.  An EKG with rate 106, normal ST-T changes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was covered empirically

with vancomycin, ceftazidime, given gentle IV fluid bolus and is

being admitted to Renal Medicine.  At this time, he is

hemodynamically stable.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Weakness, end-stage renal disease, and

possible early infection including bacteremia.

OFFICE VISIT (CHC)
The patient is seen in followup at the Community Health.  He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month.  He has had an eventful past six months.  In October, he apparently had a TIA or small stroke.  He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery.  His symptomatology fortunately clear.  His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity.  About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe.  He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin.  Not long after this, he went into renal failure.  He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium.  According to the patient and his wife, his creatinine went as high as 9.  Fortunately, it is currently back down to 2.4.


His toe lesion has been very slow to improve.  He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent.  He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania, without much improvement.  They finally told him, he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation.


On examination today, I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses.  I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level.  Resting ABI is good, although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable.  He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes.  He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe.  There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot.  This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites.  There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.


We will place him on Keflex 250 mg q.i.d. for 7 to 10 days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis.  I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering.  I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow.  Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine, which limit contrast administration.  His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this.  I will await Dr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinions.

NAME:     Oliver, Uriah 
MRN:       7916007

Primary Care Provider:  Dr. Patterson

Mr. Oliver returns for follow-up of several issues.

Weight 175.  Blood pressure 130/80. 

MEDICATIONS:   He finished Flagyl last night, and he took his last dose of levoflox
today.  Glyburide is on hold.  He is taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., Lovastatin
20 mg q.d., fosinopril 40 mg q.d., verapamil SR 240 mg q.d., ASA 1 q.d., metoprolol
75 mg three times a day and Glucophage 1000 mg b.i.d.  

(1)  Diverticulitis and history of colon cancer.  

     S:   His pain is gone although he continues to have a bad taste in his mouth
          since he has been on antibiotics. 

     O:   His abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds.  There is no tenderness
          today.  

     P:   He will need colonoscopy at the Atlantic North in a month or so. 

(2)  Diarrhea.  

     S:   He has continued to have several soft, dark bowel movements a day
          while he has been taking the antibiotic.  He has not seen any bright red
          blood per rectum.  He has been using Equal and eating ice cream.  

     O:   Stool for C. diff. and stool C&S were both negative. 

     P:   I asked him to discontinue artificial sweeteners and milk products,
          except for yogurt, for 3 days.  He will call if the diarrhea persists off the
          antibiotic.  

(3)  Guaiac-positive stool on examination last week.  

     O:   His hematocrit had increased to 35.7 last week.  

     P:   Recheck CBC.  He will bring me the name of his GI physician at the
          Atlantic North so that I can communicate with him about the recent events
          and arrange for follow-up colonoscopy.  

(4)  Dizziness.  

     S:   This has resolved. 

(5)  Diabetes. 

     S:   He stopped glyburide as directed last week when his 4 p.m. blood sugar
          was 44.  His fingerstick blood sugar was 192 this morning.  He reports
          that he is eating much better.  

     P:   He will restart glyburide 5 mg q.d. when his blood sugar is greater than
          200.

(6)  Systolic murmur and right bundle branch block.

     P:   His echocardiogram has been requested but he has not yet received the
          appointment.  

(7)  Coronary artery disease.  

     S:   He has had no chest pain.  He apparently had an appointment last week
          for an exercise tolerance test at the Atlantic North but the technician was
          not there.  He has another appointment later this week with the doctor
          at the Atlantic North.

     P:   I gave him a copy of the final NYSH discharge summary from his recent
          hospitalization as well as copies of the EKGs done during the
          hospitalization and a copy of the abdominal CT report to take to his
          doctor at the Atlantic North.

(8)  Proteinuria during the hospitalization. 

     O:   His serum creatinine was 1.5 (likely elevated given his age).  Repeat
          urinalysis showed 1+ albumin with no other significant abnormalities. 

     P:   Check 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine.  Check serum protein
          electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis. 

(9)  Chronic anemia.  

     O:   He had normal iron studies, B12 and folate several months ago.  His
          hematocrit was stable as of last week.  

     P:   Check serum protein electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis.  

(10) Decreased HDL.  

     A:   We could either add niacin or change his statin from Mevacor to Lipitor
          to increase the HDL.  

     P:   I have deferred this issue to his primary care physician. 

He will return for follow-up in 2 weeks so that we can make final arrangements for
the colonoscopy and to check progress with his diabetes.

Interim History:	

Comes to review his medical problems.



Hip X-Rays may have shown early degenerative changes. Still has pain from them on a daily basis but it is minor. Has not tried any analgesics, even acetaminophen. 

Shoulders have bothered her for years and she has seen Dr. Baird with diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Hands have bothered her in the past but do not currently. 



A1c has been over 9 % and she says that control has not changed. Does not have records but says that she tests about tid.

Nephropathy:	Cr was 1.4 in July. Says that transplant clinic wanted her to return a month after the last visit but she did not want to do so. She thinks that it was for follow-up of an elevated WBC. However, her WBC has been normal over the last several visits. 

Neuropathy:	Not consistent with taking the Neurontin, and notes it she misses it.

Cardiac:	No chest pain or unusual dyspnea on exertion. Does feel out of shape if she climbs    100 stairs   .  She is seeing Dr. Dotson in two weeks.  

Vascular:	No claudication

Overnight in the SDU, patient was given several stepwise doses of lasix. She put out about 500cc to 30 IV lasix, then another 300cc to 40 IV lasix. Patient was hypoxic on a NRB with sats in low 90s and RR of 45, but improved when transitioned to high flow O2 with saturation in high 90s and RR of 30.

Bedside TTE done in the morning confirmed aortic valve leaflet vegetations and moderate AI. CT surgery was consulted, and given prior hx of angina and recent episodes of chest pain, they requested cardiac cath prior to OR for valve replacement.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

70 yo F p/w acute CHF 2/2 aortic insufficiency from subacute aortic valve endocarditis

CV:
Ischemia: History of stable angina, no prior MI. No acute ST changes, borderline troponin elevation, recent history of chest pain at rest.
Cardiac cath today to eval for CAD
Hold anticoagulation given likely CT surgery
Pump: AV endocarditis by TTE resulting in moderate AI and significant pulmonary edema. Per discussion with microbiology lab at Community Hospital, patient was positive for Beta Strep Group B 2/2 bottles on 2/21/89, sensitivities were not done.
Continue amp/vanc/gent, await culture and sensitivity results
Continue to titrate lasix to TBB     1-2 liters per day
Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm
Continue to monitor for any development of AV block that might indicate aortic valve abscess

NIDDM
Hold metformin, RISS

Ulysses Peralta, M.D.
82 March Street
Coalinga, FL  84635


Dear Dr. Peralta:


I saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis.  He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health.  His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family.  He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days.  He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days.  He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort.  He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations.  He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved.  Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation.


We performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms.  He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162/80.  He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort.  The discomfort resolved into recovery.  He had no ST segment changes.  His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.  There was normal RV size as well.  There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible.  These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.


As you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed.


His current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d., aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d., Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium.


On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  The extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.


His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.


I think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well.  I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has.  I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin.  His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago.  I think we can maintain our current approach.  I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.


If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.


Kindest regards.


Sincerely yours,

Team 1b Medical Intern Admission Note



Pt:	Jasso, Stephen

MR#: 	 7990698

Date of Admission:  7/05/95

Attending: 	I. Ellsworth



CC:  Vertigo, EKG changes



HPI:  73   yo with h/o of DM, CAD s/p anteroseptal MI (2091) and stent placement presents with 2 days of vertigo, most prominent upon wakening in the a.m.  He reports feeling as if he is spinning while the room is stable; this sensation is worsened by changes in position or head movement.  It diminishes only slightly as the day progresses.  He denies any numbness, weakness, tingling, changes in vision or memory.  He denies any recent URI.  He does report tinnitus which has been present intermittently for years as well as bilateral sensorineural hearing secondary to gunshot exposure.  No NV. The sensation of vertigo is superimposed upon one week of gradually progressive loss of balance, described as not knowing where to put his limbs in relation to space.  He also reports ~7 days of mild diarrhea in a.m only, attributable to eating sorbitol ice cream as well as continuing to take Metamucil for the same 7 day period.  Diarrhea has been fully resolved for 2 days PTA. He does report good PO fluid intake, ~8 bottles of H20 per day.  He monitors his sugars regularly and reports they have been running in the 110-140s. He denies any fevers, chills, sweats or sick contacts.  The patient does have ptosis on the L and reports that this has been present less than one month.  He has had no changes in medications.



Additionally, the patient reports one episode of fleeting chest pain along the midaxillary line on 07/12 which was relieved immediately by NTG.  (Pt attributes the pain to gas as the belching coincident with the NTG also seemed to relieve the pain).  He does also report an increase in SOB after walking up one flight of stairs which has arisen over the past few months.

A/P:  73 yo with h/o HTN, DM, CAD presenting with 2 days of vertigo and one week of loss of balance. Symptoms of vertigo are most consistent with peripheral vertigo.  BPPV most likely as symptoms are worse in a.m and diminish over the day. Given tinnitus Meniers on the diiferential but less likely. Labarynthitis less likely as there is no antecedent infection or associated nausea.  Given multiple risk factors central process such as stroke will image brain.  Vertigo combined with loss of balance, although not elicited on exam, may represent vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  EKG changes concerning for ventricular aneurysm v. anteroseptal reinfarction if viable tissue still remains.  ROMI and Echo in a.m.



Vertigo:

--CT negative for acute process

--MRI pending

--Neurology consulted





CV:

Ischemia

-	ROMI by EKG, markers

-	Transthoracic echo in a.m.

-	continue ASA; titrate up Lopressor for goal HR = 60 as BP tolerates

-	check fasting lipids in AM, continue Lipitor

-	continue lisinopril

-	recent HbA1c 4.4



Pump

-	no signs/symptoms of failure on exam, CXR



Rhythm

-	currently NSR; titrate up BB as above

-	watch for ectopy; keep K = 4, Mg =2

Major Problems



Diabetes mellitus (adult onset)

Aug 13

S: Has history of DM2 for 20(+)years c/b peripheral neuropathy for which Mr. Jacobs takes amytriptyline with good effect. He has a hx of iritis and retinitis recently treated with steroids.  He follows-up with the Rusk State opthamologists. For foot care he sees a podiatrist at the RSH as well. There is no history of diabetic ulcer or cellulitis. He is maintained on glyburide 2.5mg for several years and he checks his BS qd with range of 100-150 and occasional episodes of hypoglycemia. His last AIC was 4.4% in 9/95. At this time his UA showed no proteinuria and his renal function is within normal limits. He is on an ACEi. His diabetic care is well managed at the Diabetic clinic by Whitney Bullock. 

P: c/w glyburide and current endocrine/optho/podiatry care.



Atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease

S: Mr. Jacobs has a hx of anteroseptal MI in 2092 and is s/p left main stent placement. In July of 2095, he had a TTE which was remarkable for an EF of 23%, reduced from 31% in 2092. Also notable for anteroseptal AK and infero-posterior HK. AD-MIBI in 9/95 with anteroseptal scar, but no ischemia. Does about 30 minutes of aerobic physical activity each morning without issue. No CP or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND, LE edema. 

P: DM (AIC 4.4) and lipid control (LDL 59) is optimal. Medical Regimen consists of  ASA, BB, ACEi, Statin. Is a patient of Dr. Dunham and plan to see him annually. I wonder if he should be anticoagulated given his diffuse HK and whether he should be considered for BiV pacing.





Health maintenance

CAD: please see problem list

Tob: quit 25 years ago

EtOH: neg 

Exercise: intensive exercise regimen, but limited as of late by neuropathy

Seatbelts: y 

Sunscreen: y 

Vaccines: gets tetanus/pneumo at RSH (2095) and flu shot in the fall.

ID/CC:75 YO M with chest pain 	







HPI: 

This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain. The first episode started this AM (10AM). It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic. Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v. Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.  He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case. He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.  Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain. On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain. He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker. His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3. 

First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro.

Assessment

 73 yo man with type 2 DM and CAD, with worsening glycemic control over the last several months.  Nl bone density despite kyphosis.  



Plan

1. Diabetes

--Glycemia: I estimate his Cr clearance to be 73 cc/min.  Therefore, I recommended and wrote out for him:

a. Increase glipizide to 5 mg po qd

b. Start metformin 500 mg po bid, increase to 1000 mg po bid if no abd sx.  If he can tolerate this, woudl d/c glipizide.

--Pt education re above.

--Ophtho referral



2. Dyslipidemia: controlled on Lipitor



3. Hypertension: controlled, but on the border; may need another agent.



4. Cardiac disease:followed by Dr.Upton; to be referred for ICD eval given CAD and low EF.  On ASA.



5. Decreased vibratory sense: needs B12 on next lab draw.



F/U  December.

Dear Iva:



Irene Zastrow, 66 years old, returned for followup of coronary artery disease and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that she suffered in Pennsylvania on 10/29/2085.  At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.  On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.  On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.



She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have ""ramped up"" her cardiac medications.  She has no shortness of breath.  She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.  She does get epigastric discomfort.



Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.



The review of systems is negative other than the above.



On physical examination, she appears well.  Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.  HEENT:  Normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The skin has no rash.



Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.



I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.



Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.



I am prescribing physical therapy for her ""stiff neck.""



I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.



I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.  I will plan to see her again in about four months.



Best personal regards.



Sincerely yours,

MICROBIOLOGY:



Nil current.




RADIOLOGY:



6/25/64 CT ABDO:

There is mild to moderate stenosis of the origins of the celiac and 

     SMA.  The IMA is occluded.  There is a moderate stenosis of the right 

     renal artery origin.  There are two left renal arteries.  The upper 

     renal artery is an accessory muscle and has a mild to moderate 

     stenosis at its origin.  The left renal artery has a high-grade 

     stenosis at its origin.  There is a circumaortic left renal vein.

      

     There is a chronic penetrating ulcer with focal aortic dissection of 

     the visceral segment of the abdominal aorta.  There is a moderate 

     stenosis of the left common iliac artery origin.

      

     The kidneys are unremarkable.

      

     The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. 

     There is no intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy.

      

     There is cholelithiasis.  The common bile duct is 2.1 cm in diameter 

     with a probable common duct stone.

      

     There are no bony lytic or blastic lesions.

      

     The visualized lungs are clear. There is centrilobular emphysema, 

     mild.  There are no pleural effusions.

      

     

     IMPRESSION:

      

     1.  Cholelithiasis with a dilated common bile duct and a common duct 

     stone.

      

     2.  No significant mesenteric arterial compromise.  The IMA is 

     occluded.

      

     3.  Stenosis of both left renal arteries, with the larger left renal 

     artery severely stenotic.

      

     4.  Mild to moderate stenosis of the right renal artery.

      

     5.  Chronic penetrating ulcer with focal dissection of the distal 

     segment of the abdominal aorta.

      


5/30/63 CAROTID US:

IMPRESSION


1. Bilateral moderate 50-69% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries.


2. &lt; 50% stenosis noted in the distal left common carotid artery.


3. No significant stenosis in the left external carotid artery.


4. Probable hemodynamically significant stenosis in the right external carotid

  artery.


4. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.


5. Normal flow in both subclavian arteries.




PREVIOUS ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATIONS:



Per the patient and his sons he was evalueated &gt;10 yrs ago w/ a colonoscopy which noted a single small benign polyp.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:




87M h/o CAD (3vd), PVD, DM, HTN moderate b/l carotid stenosis, chronic ulcer in the distal ulcer w/ dissection, w/ a dilated CBD and choledocholithiasis for which we are consulted.



We will plan for further evaluation of the patient&#8217;s biliary system with an ERCP. 
Given the location of the largest stone i.e. not impacted with very slight LFT derangement I am concerned for alternative sources of the patient&#8217;s biliary dilation (e.g. pancreatic ca).



I have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate.






Recommendations:



-cont cipro/flagyl, if any concerns for decompsenation would add ampicillin also

-IVF

-clear liquids ok until midnight

-NPO from midnight

-neurology consult for risk of GA given carotid artery disease burden

-please confirm with vascular surg ERCP/GA safe given dissection/aortic ulcer present

-patient waitlisted for ERCP w/ GA on 6/27/64

EDVISIT^28297534^OGRADY, MICHAEL^03/16/98^OCASIO, GEORGE OJAS

I saw this patient with resident Dr. Elijah Parker.  Please see

his note for further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed

and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation

on the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male

with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery

disease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,

status post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube.  He was

discharged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough.  He

had been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed

with a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was also given 1 g of

ceftriaxone.  His complaints prior to presentation had been chest

pain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and

palpitations.  On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem

and Lopressor discontinued on his last admission.  Other systems

were reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,

hemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.  Please see the chart.  He is currently

on aspirin and took today.

ALLERGIES:  IV dye and Neurontin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, but cachectic

appearing, and nontoxic.  Temperature 98, pulse of 111,

respirations 20, blood pressure 104/61, and oxygen saturations

are 95%, however, this is on 5 liters.  HEENT exam:  Mucosal

membranes are dry.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. 

Lungs:  Crackles at the right lung.  Left lung is clear.  CVS: 

Tachycardic but regular.  Abdomen:  There is some mild diffuse

tenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no

Murphy's.  He has normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and

dry.  Back is nontender at CVA points.  He has got bilateral

lower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and

calves.  Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented

without focal motor or sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2

bands.  Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated

with creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of

1.2 when he was discharged.  LFTs are all normal including lipase

and total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly

elevated.  First set of cardiac enzymes is negative.  EKG shows a

sinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave

changes.  Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have

been there in the past.  There is a hazy opacity in the right mid

hemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could

represent tumor versus pneumonia.  However, no significant change

prior to his discharge.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Given his dyspnea and his elevated

white count, this case was discussed with Oncology.  He was

admitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia.  He is in stable

condition.

Has had no exertional chest pains.  Urinates two to three times a
night but not very frequently during the day.  Ran out of her
Lopressor yesterday.  Continues to have some discomfort in her
right buttock radiating down the side of her leg.  Not happy with
the orthotics that were given her for her arch pain because she can
only use them with bulkier shoes.  Has had some right shoulder
discomfort.  
 
Meds:  Procardia XL 120 mg. q.d.  Aspirin 325 mg. q.d.  Lopressor
100 mg. b.i.d.  Micronase 5 mg. q.d.  
 
W. 141.  176/90 in the left arm, 178/90 in the right.  80.  Good
range of motion of the right shoulder.  There is some crepitance
over the AC joint.  No subdeltoid or bicipital tendon tenderness. 
Full range of motion.  Lungs are clear.  Soft, positive S4.  No
pedal edema.
 
1.  CAD.  Doing well without angina.
 
2.  Hypertension.  I renewed her Lopressor. Will recheck this after
she has been taking both medications faithfully.
 
3.  Diabetes.  Will check a glucose today and I renewed her
Micronase.
 
4.  Question right sciatica.  She is not interested in any invasive
therapy so we will not pursue imaging at this time.  She had a
negative CT in 2073.  I put her on 400 mg. of Motrin three times a
day.
 
5.  Arch pain.  This is clearly not that bothersome that she feels
that it is more important to wear lighter shoes.  
 
6.  Right shoulder pain. She may have some mild rotator cuff
tendinitis. We discussed the importance of not overusing this
shoulder and avoiding lifting anything heavier than a coffee cup. 
Motrin 400 mg. t.i.d. on a full stomach.  I showed her some range
of motion exercises.

OFFICE NOTE
 
Perla Esposito
MRN:146-55-23-5
4/08/79
 
Follow-up visit for this 77-year-old Chilean woman. 
 
She comes today bothered by right-sided shoulder pain. On a
previous visit she had complained of this and I wanted to put her
on Motrin but she wanted to try Tylenol. The pain bothers her
sometimes at night and is throbbing. It bothers her when she
tries to attach her bra behind her back. Other than that she has
been doing fairly well. She has not had any chest pains. She has
not had any symptoms of TIAs. She has a lot of concern about her
chronic renal insufficiency and wants to discuss this. 
 
Medications: Lopressor. Hydochlorothiazide. Procardia XL.
Micronase. Motrin. Aspirin.
 
Allergies: Lisinopril causes hypokelemia.
 
Family History: Non-contributory. 
 
Social History: She has a daughter, Rhodes, who has been very
supportive. No cigarettes or alcohol. 
 
Review of Systems: She refuses general GYN screening. She had a
hemoglobin A1C in March, which was 6.4. She had an ophthalmology
exam in September. 
 
Physical Examination: Worried. Weight 131 lb. Blood pressure
142/60. Pulse is 72. Skin exam unremarkable. HEENT: EOMI. No
scleral icterus. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. I cannot
hear any carotid bruits. Lungs are clear. No murmurs. No gallops.
Benign abdomen. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No pedal edema.
Examination of the right shoulder shows that she has tenderness
on abduction beyond 110 but her most marked tenderness is with
her internal rotation and she is unable to do this further than
L5.
 
Procedure: The right subdeltoid bursa was prepped with Betadine.
The skin was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine in a 27 gauge needle.
The subdeltoid bursa itself was entered with a 21 gauge needle
and a mixture of 1cc of 1% Xylocaine and 40mg of Depo-Medrol was
injected. She tolerated the procedure well.

RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    
MRN: 80910690                                                           
  
Dear Dr. Irvine:
 
I had the chance today to see Terri Bird in follow-up, as her 
primary care physician. As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female 
who resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you 
have been taking care of her. I have not seen her now for the past ten 
months. For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history 
briefly. It includes a history of atrial fibrillation. She is status 
post an MVR with Duluth Clinic. She is on chronic anti-coagulation. She is 
status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of 
strep glomerular nephritis. She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for 
several decades with no history of rejection. She also has a history of 
a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement. As well, she has a 
history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated 
intermittently with epidural steroid injection. About a year ago, she 
had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed 
some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle 
fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different 
nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle 
fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home. I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization 
where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully 
treated with levofloxacin. 
 
MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received 
include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, 
Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, 
Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg 
three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on 
her INR.
 
ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and 
cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose 
which seems to have been stopped. As well, she is on sliding scale 
insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently. 
RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    
MRN: 80910690

The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were 
concerned that she was not getting optimal care. In talking to her, she 
says she feels quite well. She has no pain. She has no pain in her 
buttocks or her legs. She says her breathing feels well. She has no 
productive cough. She has no chest pain. She denies any peripheral 
edema. She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough 
exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she 
is getting reasonable care. However, she does breakdown and cry about 
her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing 
home. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70. 
She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72. She 
has sharp clicks over her chest. She has a soft abdomen with no 
organomegaly and a well healed scar. She has equal pulses bilaterally. 
She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags. She has a full 
range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and 
ankles. She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and 
she seems relatively stable. She is somewhat confused about the date and 
the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly 
about her current situation at Elm Hills. 
 
I have no laboratory data to speak of. 
 
I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son 
and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety 
and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an 
unsupervised setting. I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable 
place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an 
antidepressant. It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her 
recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of 
SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects. 
 
I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, 
but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact 
me with questions about her past history. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Steve George, M.D.

Reason for visit:

   Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest



Interval History:

   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today. His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.



His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.



He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.



He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.



Past medical history:

   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT



Medications (Confirmed):



			

Dalmane 30 mg

glyburide 2.5mg po qd

Lipitor 20 mg

lisinopril 5 mg po qd

metformin hydrochloride 500 mg

Nexium 40mg po qd



Physical examination:

-BP: 110/70  

-Pulse: 50  

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ pedal pulses.



EKG:

   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB. Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.



Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.  We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.



The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

Re:  	Quijano, Donny 

	SMC Unit # 544-84-52



Dear Dr. Galvan:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.



He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.  Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.  



No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.



No reflux symptoms.



Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.



He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.



Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d. (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.



On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.  Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sinuses nontender.  Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.  Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.  No goiter or adenopathy.  Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.  Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.  Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Skin:  Well tanned.



Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.



CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.



Impression:



Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.



Probable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.



Ischemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.



Myasthenia, mainly ocular.



Prior Raynaud's syndrome.



Recommendations:



Continue Advair at the current dose.



Trial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o. q. p.m.



Low threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.



Continue exercise program.



Return visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.



Sincerely yours,

Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID.  Added low-dose glyburide 1.25 mg QD in October, for hemoglobin A1c 7.80.  Followup hemoglobin A1c last month better, 7.10.  Asked him to concentrate more on diet.  Says he is up-to-date with Ophthalmology.



Hyperlipidemia

Lipitor 10 mg QD.  Tolerating well.  Check followup lipids, CK, and transaminases.  Target LDL 70.



Coronary artery disease

Followed by Dr.  Middleton.  Suffered a cardiac arrest while skiing January 2072.  Resuscitated, cardioverted, sent to Lowell General Hospital, transferred to SMC.  Cath showed 70% distal left main; 90% proximal LAD; 90% first diagonal; 60% left circumflex; 40% first marginal; RCA normal.  Underwent three-vessel bypass grafting (SVG to LAD, diagonal, OM).  Has done well since then.  Most recent ETT January 2076 showed an equivocal mild apical reversible defect, but nothing else.  Asymptomatic.     02/23/2077:   Remains asymptomatic.  Continue medical management which at this point consists of antiplatelet therapy, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.



Asthma

Severe in childhood.  Now mild/intermittent, occasional/episodic shortness of breath.  Probably aggravated by GERD.  Followed by Dr.  Nye of Pulmonary; sees his notes.  Doing well with inhalers, Singulair.  Lungs clear today.     02/23/2077:   Recently treated with Levaquin for questionable left lower lobe infiltrate.  Followup chest film negative.  Symptoms have resolved.  Lungs are clear on exam.  Continue followup with pulmonary.  Takes Advair 500/50, albuterol PRN, and Singulair 10 mg QD.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  PPI therapy has been recommended, but  has not been very compliant.  Given another prescription today.     02/23/2077:   Complains that omeprazole gives him diarrhea.  Change to Protonix 40 mg QD.

Hyperlipidemia

Lipitor 10 mg QD.  Tolerating well.  Check followup lipids, CK, and transaminases.  Target LDL 70.02/27/2077:  Recent lipid profile excellent with LDL 72, HDL 70, triglycerides 46, and total cholesterol 151.  Serum CPK, June 2076, SGOT 74, and SGPT 41.  Review of prior test results discloses chronic low-grade elevation serum CK. Spoke with the patient; no myalgias, arthralgias, or fevers. Possibly related to Lipitor.  Discontinue, substitute pravastatin.  Return in four weeks to recheck CK and transaminases.  The patient understands.  Call in the meantime for problems or questions.     05/25/2077:   Now on pravastatin without side effects.  CK unchanged.  Continue to follow.

Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID, glyburide 1.25 mg QD.  He is trying to be much more disciplined with his diet and as a result, according to his wife, he is experiencing fairly frequent minor hypoglycemic episodes.  His last hemoglobin A1c six months ago was 6.50.  Recheck today.  I suspect we will be able to discontinue the glyburide.  Urine albumin/creatinine ratio within normal limits six months ago.



Coronary artery disease

Cardiac arrest January 2072 while skiing; multivessel disease on cath; underwent three-vessel bypass (SVGs to the LAD, diagonal, OM).  Most recent ETT January 2076 showed equivocal mild apical reversible defect.  Remains active, has had no chest discomfort of any kind or palpitations.  Continue medical management.



Myasthenia gravis

Remains on Mestinon.  Denies symptoms.



Hyperlipidemia

Remains on pravastatin.  Total cholesterol 151, HDL 70, LDL 72, triglycerides 46 February 2077.  Complains of occasional leg spasms but has no fevers or GI symptoms.  Check CK and transaminases.



Asthma

He continues to be followed by Dr.  Nye; see his notes.  Continues to have occasional episodes of very minor shortness of breath at rest, never with exercise.  Lungs clear.  Doing well.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  Compliant with PPI.  No symptoms.



Anemia

Longstanding issue, hematocrit in mid 30s, MCV mid 90s, iron studies, ferritin, B12, and folate unremarkable.  Check TSH, SPEP.05/25/2077:   TSH and SPEP unremarkable.  Check EPO level, follow CBC.     11/21/2077:   EPO level inappropriately low.  Therefore, suspect anemia is secondary to age-related reduction in renal mass/GFR.



Hypertension

On low-dose ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  Blood pressure today uncharacteristically elevated, 150/70.  He attributes this to rushing to get to his appointment with me.  Blood pressure earlier this month was 120/55 at his pulmonary visit.  I suspect that he is probably well controlled overall.  For now, no change in management.

History of Present Illness

Asked by Dr. Ehlers to consult on glycemic management for Mr. Ulysses Ehlers who has no history of DM but was noted to be hyperglycemic postop. Mr. Ehlers is POD 1, s/p C4. His family history is positive for diabetes (mother diagnosed in her 80s).  He has required a regular insulin gtt protocol intermittently postop. He is now on a full liquid diet.



Max BG: 197

Current BG: 145

Insulin gtt off at present

 

Mr. Ehlers is a 69 yo M h/o CAD s/p MI 2084 (posterolateral), HTN, hyperlipidemia, a-fib, AAA, PVD, smoking (50 pk yr) who presents for CABG. Initially presented to Bonner General Hospital 9/97 for w/u of exertional chest pain. Cardiac cath was unsuccessful via femoral approach due to presumed aortoiliac occlusion. Subsequent cath 10/18/97 revealed left main stenosis with distal occlusion, RCA proximal occlusion and diffuse LAD stenosis. Pt was transferred to BHCC on 10/19 for further evaluation by the cardiology service. On 10/21 he underwent echo which revealed EF 55% with mild AS. On 10/22, cardiac cath revealed 3 V disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended CABG after medical optimization. His anginal symptoms remained stable and he was subsequently discharged home on 10/23. He now returns for surgical revascularization. Since his discharge on 10/23, he has not experienced any new or worsening chest pain or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND. 

 

Preoperative Cardiac Status: Myocardial infarction 2084, requiring hospitalization. Myocardial infarction 2084, requiring hospitalization. The patient has a history of class I angina (no limitation of ordinary physical activity). There has been no recent angina. The patient does not have symptomatic heart failure. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of AF/flutter 

 

Previous Cardiovascular Interventions: None. 

 

Past Medical History: Hypertension. Peripheral vascular disease 3.6cm abdominal aortic aneurysm . Dyslipidemia. CAD Atrial fibrillation BPH Chronic back pain PVD Bicuspid aortic valve, mild AS/AI /Creatinine Clearance (estimate): 77.31 cc/min

 

Past Surgical History: s/p R inguinal hernia repair 

 

Family History: Coronary artery disease. Father died of CAD at age 88 

 

Social History: History of tobacco use. 50 pack year cigarette smoking history. Used within the last year. History of alcohol use. 1/month. The patient is a Cardiology Technologist.

       Procedure: This 73 year old male with Cervical Herniation is scheduled for a Cervical Laminectomy with Fusion on Jan. 21, 2095 by Dr. Noah Blanchard



       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.  He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.  He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081. He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects. Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.  evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally





        Past Medical History:  

1.  Paraplegia secondary to Compression fracture in Amusement Park accident in 2066

2.  cervical spondylosis

3.  COPD uses prn Albuterol MDI

4.  CAD S/P CABG X3 in 2087 catheterization done in March 2090.  Recent stress done in May 2094

History of CABG, known hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, dyspnea on exertion, cancer, smoking. S/P B/L CEA, Cath '90 - occluded SVG to Cx, patent LIMA. patent SVG to RCA. Admitted with (L) sided chest pain, ruled out for MI by enzymes. Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia. PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia. DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain. Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan. PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min. Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

               73 year old male with cervical disc herniation scheduled for Cervical  Laminectomy with fusion on Jan. 24, 2094 by Dr Blanchard.  He has co morbid diseases IDDM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, COPD, Paraplegia, Hx of uti and depression. His last surgery was in 2092 ORIF left Tibia IV sedation with spinal anesthesia no complication noted in anesthesai record..  There has been difficulty placing the IV ( pt said this happens a lot). According to note from 3/07/81 anesthesia for previous cervical Laminectomy  Rapid sequence induction MAC #3 8.0 ETT easy intubation. Pt was a smoker for 50 years occasionally uses Albuterol with a spacer suggested he use it pre op .  He had a stress test done in May 2094 and it was negative for ischemia and a LVEF was 50%.  Report in this note under Medical Problems.  He was admitted for ""chest pain "" in May 2094 and he no longer is using the NTG sl or the Nitropace.  He was told the ""pains"" he feels is most likely from his CABG ( CABG X3)- Grafts to RCA patent,occluded at circumflex, LIMA patent and the post sternal pain. The stress test was done during this admission as well as a CAT scan to r/o aortic dissection. ( also negative)  his biggest problem seems to be his ""not very well controlled diabetes"".  There is a note from the May 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of Nexium to see if his ""chest pain"" was epigastric"" but pt and wife said he never received this medication.  He denies any GERD or ""chest pain"" since may 2094.  He recognizes his hypoglycemia sx's and  also his hyper glycemia sx's ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.  He will not take his Glyburide the night before surgery and the morning of.. He will take 1/2 dose of Insulin the morning of 15 untis NPH.    He denies any medication allergies but staes that ""muscle relaxants"" cause his legs to become flaccid.

TEAM 2 ACCEPT NOTE

Patient's name: Frank Keatering	
MRN: 	4832978
Date of Admission to MICU: 	12/11/95
Date of transfer to Internal Medicine: 	12/13/95

ID/CC:  acute loss of motor/sensation at level of T8

History Obtained From: Pt, old charts, transfer note.

History of Present Illness:  74 y/o man with h/o paraplegia 2/2 compression fracture and wheelchair bound, vascular dz, with recent bilateral ileofemoral and renal artery stent (11/24/95) and recent cardiac cath stent to the circumflex (11/28/95). Pt presented to OSH 12/10 with c/o abdominal pain onset the PM prior to admission, diffuse in nature, localized in the mid-epigastric region, RUQ, and LUQ with a pain scale of 8-10/10 pain. Per charts he reported decreased pain in the am with ability to tolerate PO's and then increasing pain that afternoon. Also associated with diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting, no sob. During placement of a central line at OSH ED, pt experienced shaking during procedure and had acute loss of motor and sensory strength in the LE's. Per Nursing chart at OSH ED, pt given Morphine for abd pain (around 4p-8p) with coffee ground emesis at 8pm with subsequent decrease in BP to 76/49 and started on dopamine for pressure support. At the same time, pt c/o numbness in feet. Per charts he was reported to be bending forward coughing and vomiting and experienced acute loss of sensation/motor function in the abdomen and lower extremities.

Course at the outside hospital- 
1.Neuro- acute loss of sensation/motor at the level of T8. Per Neurology, had paraplegic legs, no sphincter tone, no anal wink, Sx were concerning for aortic dissection. Abd US unrevealing but was reported as a poor study. CT of T8-T10 did not show gross deviations of spine, no soft tissue masses or disk bulging.  
2.GI- Coffee ground emesis at OSH, with no fresh blood- with dropping HCT 44-40-35 and transfused 1 U pRBC on 12/11.  Also guiac +.  Etiology thought to be 2/2 ASA and plavix.  No egd was performed and amlyase and lipase, and LFTs were nl per report.  
3.ID- Pt was hypotensive with SBP in the 70's on presentation with good response to fluids, In setting of elevated WBC to 22 pt was empirically treated with Abx (zosyn, flagyl and vanc). BCx were sent and CXR appeared clear.
4.CARDIAC- Cardiac enzymes were followed with increasing Troponins: 0.04    0.07    0.08    0.09, CK index: 3.0    3.7. No complaints of chest pain during his stay. And no report of signifigant EKG changes. 
5.Renal- Creatinine increase from 2.6 to 3.1 thought to be 2/2 Acute on chronic RF.

Pt transferred to HOB for further eval of r/o dissection, r/o cord compression, GIB, poss abd ischemia, ARI/CRI

Review of System on admission: 
CV: no orthopnea, no PND
Resp: sob, no cough, no sputum production 
GI: abdominal pain as above, no melena, no BRBPR, able to have BM
GU: per OSH ED report of dark urine in ileostomy bag x2d with decreased UOP
Musculoskeletal: baseline decreased to minimal movement in the LLE, min-mod movement in right leg, able to transfer to and from wheelchair
Neuro/Psych: alert and oriented x3.

MICU Course:
1.Paraplegia:  Has baseline deficits (wheelchair bound), but unclear how they compare to current exam--> level at T5/T6.  
- first MRI showed low T2 signal collections from T6--> L1 with displacement of thoracic cord anteriorly from T7-T10. 
-no cord compression on repeat study, however ddx still includes cord infarction vs demyelinating disease
-neurosurg, neuro consulted, following
2.Respiratory status: Acute desaturation 2/2 methemoglobinemia as consequence of topical anesthetic
- s/p methylene blue (80 mg x 1, 40 mg x 1) with resolution of methemoglobin from 35% to 1%. 
3.Renal failure:  Possibilities raised include cholesterol emboli from recent interventions, relative hypoperfusion with normalization of blood pressure. 
- urine eos negative
- Cr 2.9-->2.5 today
4.Abdominal pain: mild-moderate stenosis just beyond origin of SMA seen on MRA; considered mesenteric ischemia a/w low flow state. However, lactic acid 1.3, and pH wnl 
- have liberalized bp parameters now that dissection ruled out
5.GI bleed: coffee ground emesis-- unclear if this reflects enteric ischemia vs. sentinel bleeding
-GI team consulted
6.Coronary artery disease:
- troponin 0.14 on admission, but subsequently all wnl, likely troponin leak in setting of GIB prior to admission
- taken off ASA, plavix in context of suspected UGIB
- cont lopressor 
- hydral, isordil, goal SBP 140-150
7.Hemodynamics:
- TEE with no dissection
- TTE with EF 54%, no SWMA, no tamponade
- metoprolol +/- isordil/hydral
8.Diabetes mellitus
- on MICU insulin protocol, will switch to sliding scale

MICRO: Urine, blood cx x 2 NGTD at HOB; VRE neg x1; MRSA nasal swab neg x1

EKG: NSR at 80, nl axis, old ST depressions in V4-5

CXR (12/13):  Stable chest without new or enlarging infiltrates or pneumonias.
	Cardiac size normal, no signs of edema or decompensation.
	Operative changes as before and right subclavian central line as
	before without apparent pneumothorax or complication.

MRI (12/12): 
EXAMINATION: MRI of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine.
	EXAMINATION DATE: 12/12/95.
	Comparison films: The prior films are available for comparison to
	due PACS technical difficulties. Comparison is made with the
	report of prior C-spine CT from January 2095.
	History:72 year old man with history of paraplegia from traumatic
	injury in 2066 with new sensation loss and motor loss below T8.
	Technique:Sagittal T2 images were obtained of the cervical,
	thoracic, lumbar spine.  The Axial T2 images are obtained from T10
	through L1. The images are moderately motion degraded in the
	thoracic and lumbar spine.  The cervical spine MRI was repeated
	three times due to motion. No contrast was used.
	Findings:
	CERVICAL SPINE:
	Straightening of the cervical lordosis is noted from C2 through
	C6. Bone marrow signal demonstrates patchy areas of T2 high signal
	within the C4 and C5 vertebral body.  Posterior disc osteophyte
	complexes are present at C2/C3, C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6, C6/C7.
	The patient is status post posterior laminectomy and fusion which
	causes susceptibility artifact. The laminectomy from C3 through
	C7, previously noted, is not well visualized due to motion
	artifact and susceptibility.
	THORACIC SPINE:
	There is partial fusion of T4 to T5 with loss of height of T4 and
	focal kyphosis at this area. Myelomalacia is noted from T1 through
	T5. There is focal T2 high signal within the cord substance at the
	T4 level.
	T2 low signal collections are noted posterior to the cord at T6
	through T12.  A high signal septation is present through this
	collection at T7 and extending from T11 through L1. This low T2
	signal collection displaces the cord anteriorly from T7 through
	T10.
	The cord is small from T7 through T10 consistent with myelomalacia
	and high T2 signal.
	High signal is also present in the cord substance of the distal
	thoracic cord and at the conus.
	Small amount of T2 high signal is noted in encircling the distal
	thoracic cord and the spinal roots.
	LUMBAR SPINE:
	Straightening of the lumbar spine is noted with grade 1
	retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. There is a levoscoliosis with apex at
	L4/L5.
	Disc demonstrates T2 shortening within several lumbar discs and
	disc height loss at L4/L5, L5/S1.
	T2 high signal at the endplates are noted around the L4/L5 and
	L5/S1 disc levels.   Moderate to severe stenosis of the bilateral
	neural foramen at L5/S1 facet osteoarthritis and disc height loss
	of L5/S1 is noted. The patient has had prior surgery of the
	spinous processes of L4 and L5.
	The conus terminates at L1/L2. The spinal roots appear clumped
	centrally and there is T2 high signal around the upper spinal
	roots. T2 high signal is noted at the distal aspect of the thecal
	sac.
IMPRESSION:
	 1.  Low T2 signal collections from T6 through L1 with
	displacement of the thoracic cord anteriorly from T7 through T10.
	The differential diagnosis for this collection includes unusual
	flow artifact or multiloculated septations or epidural
	collections.  Recommend dedicated thoracic and lumbar spine MRI
	with contrast and T2 axials through the L spine and C spine. If
	clinically indicated, consider repeat C spine MRI with contrast.
	Dr. Winters was informed of this at 2:15 PM on 12/12/95.
	2.  Myelomalacia of the thoracic cord from T4-T5 level and at
	T7-10.
	3.  The spinal roots are incompletely imaged but have a clumped in
	appearance suggesting arachnoiditis. Repeat axial images through
	the entire spinal roots could better evaluate this.
	4. Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine at L4/L5 and
	L5/S1. degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine at C3/C4
	C4/C5 C5/C6.
	5.  Prior surgical fusion of the cervical spine and laminectomies
	are incompletely evaluated on the study due to motion.  Please see
	prior CT report for the details.
	6.  Mild focal kyphosis with height loss at T4 appears subacute
	and may be from prior trauma.

MRI (12/13):	
MRI THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM
	History: History of previous cord compression. Status post recent
	aorto-bifemoral bypass. Now with sudden onset of loss of lower
	extremity motor function and sensation.
	Comparison: MRI spine dated 12/12/95.
	Procedure: Multiplanar MR imaging of the entire spine was
	performed without and with Gadolinium.
	Findings:
	There is an old compression fracture at T5.  There is exaggeration
	of the normal kyphosis at this level.  There is no evidence of
	marrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine.  There is
	straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis.  There is grade 1
	retrolisthesis of L4 on L5.  There is degenerative change in the
	L4-5 and L5-S1 end plates.  There is increased T2 signal in the
	L4-5 and L5-S1 discs however the adjacent endplates are well
	preserved, and although infection cannot be completely excluded,
	it is considered very unlikely.  There is a small central disc
	protrusion at T8-9.
	There is no evidence of significant canal stenosis in the thoracic
	or lumbar spine.
	Examination of the cord demonstrates myelomalacia extending from
	the T5 level inferiorly.  There is prominent flow artifact in the
	CSF surrounding the myelomalacic cord.  The conus is expanded and
	demonstrates hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences.  There is no
	associated enhancement.  No vascular flow voids are identified.
	There is a small right pleural effusion.  There is consolidation
	at the right lung base.  This may represent atelectasis or
	infiltrate and correlation with chest x-ray is recommended.
IMPRESSION:
	Expansion and signal abnormality in the conus superimposed on
	chronic myelomalacia. The differential diagnosis includes cord
	infarction, and demyelinating disease.  Vascular malformation and
	neoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular
	flow voids and abnormal enhancement.


MRA:  MRA of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental
	protocol.
	FINDINGS:
	Due to the nature of MRI imaging, dedicated sequences were
	performed to evaluate the vasculature. The remainder of the
	abdominal organs are not fully evaluated and if clinically
	indicated, directed sequences could be performed.
	This was a technically limited study due to suboptimal contrast
	bolus and movement.  The patient was agitated and unable to
	cooperate .
	No evidence for an aortic dissection is identified.
	There is moderate stenosis of the left subclavian artery just
	beyond its origin.
	The celiac trunk is patent.
	There is mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the
	superior mesenteric artery.
	The renal arteries cannot be assessed on this study.
IMPRESSION:
	1.  Limited study due to technical factors and patient movement
	however no evidence of an aortic dissection is identified.  A
	repeat MRI with better contrast bolus and sedation may be obtained
	if clinically indicated.
	2.  Moderate stenosis is noted just distal to the origin of the
	left subclavian artery.
3.	Mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the SMA.

CT Spine (12/13): report pending
_____________________________________________________________________
Assessment/Plan: 74 y/o vasculopath presenting with new neurological deficits, abdominal pain, UGI bleed, progressive renal failure, initially worrisome for aortic dissection. Unifying diagnosis remains obscure- ? occlusive atheroemboli vs epidural hematoma.

1.Paraplegia: Has baseline deficits (wheelchair bound), but unclear how they compare to current exam--> level at T5/T6. First MRI showed low T2 signal collections from T6--> L1 with displacement of thoracic cord anteriorly from T7-T10; no cord compression on repeat study, however ddx still includes cord infarction vs demyelinating disease
-neurology and neurosurgery following
-awaiting spinal CT to evaluate for epidural hematoma
-in addition, neurology has asked for MRI with line diffusion and MPGR sequence to r/o infarction, which has been ordered

2.Respiratory status: Acute desaturation 2/2 methemoglobinemia as consequence of topical anesthetic; s/p methylene blue (80 mg x 1, 40 mg x 1) with resolution of methemoglobin from 35% to 1%, now on 4L NC sats are 95%.
-cont O2 and wean as tolerated
-enter hurricane spray as allergy

3.Renal failure:  Possibilities raised include cholesterol emboli from recent interventions, relative hypoperfusion with normalization of blood pressure. No contrast at OSH; urine eos negative; FENa= 0.94%; Cr 3.1    2.5 today
-follow Cr

4.Abdominal pain: mild-moderate stenosis just beyond origin of SMA seen on MRA; considered mesenteric ischemia a/w low flow state. However, lactic acid 1.3, and pH wnl 
- will follow acid/base status, lytes, pain

5.GI bleed: coffee ground emesis-- unclear if this reflects enteric ischemia vs. ulcer in setting of plavix, ASA
-GI team following, planning on probable EGD 12/15
-holding ASA, plavix for now

6.Cards- ISCHEMIA: troponin 0.14 on admission, but subsequently all wnl, likely troponin leak in setting of GIB prior to admission
- off ASA, plavix in context of suspected UGIB
- maintain Hct > 30
- cont lopressor 
PUMP: TEE with no dissection; TTE with EF 54%, no SWMA, no tamponade
- metoprolol, isordil/hydral goal SBP 140-150
RHYTHM - NSR

7.Diabetes mellitus: sliding scale QID
- will convert to NPH once requirements determined

8.FEN: resume diet as EGD likely on Monday

9.Prophylaxis: cont nexium, holding fragmin given concern for bleeding

10.Dispo: Will need rehab once stable; PT/OT

HPI: Mr. Keating is a 75 year-old male with a complex medical history which includes a history of a stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer, secondary to being bedridden due to paraplegia (due to injury in 2066).  His ulcer was eroding into his rectum and therefore he underwent sigmoid colostomy 8/96 for diversion.  He is also s/p ileal loop urostomy in the distant past.  Was seen in plastics clinic today, decub progressing well, but poor POs, referred for admission.  Denies N/V, has had normal ostomy output, denies abd pain, though he did have some cramping several days ago.  His main complaint is long-standing back pain.  Of note, he had been readmitted about 2 weeks postop with distention and pain, CT showing partial SBO and a pelvic fluid collection, which was drained, cultures were sterile.  Wife noted some discharge from midline wound several days ago, but this has ceased.

A/P:  75yr man s/p sig colostomy for diversion, s/p IR drainage of postop collection, now with FTT, acute renal failure with FENA>1% and possible UTI, non-gap metabolic acidodis

--Check C-dif

--UTI Rx, directed towards the gram negatives he has grown in the past

--Agree with transfusion given CAD hx

--Routine ostomy care, ostomy nurse consult for any ostomy related questions. The ostomy itself appears very healthy, so I doubt the thickening represents hypoperfusion to the distal bowel

--Please contact BCH Surgical Service with any questions

Impression/Plan: 
76yoM h/o paraplegia, p/w fever, cough.  Likely flu, +/- PNA (CXR not that impressive).  COPD flare on top of flu.  Will cover with antibiotics, treat for COPD flare.  Patient has been complaining of recent C/P, similar to anginal equivalent.  Small troponin leak, likely in setting of hypovolemic hypotension.

HoTN: c/w aggressive fluid resuscitation.  Patient clinically appears well.
	-IVF for now.
	-hold norvasc, imdur. Low dose lopressor for now.
	-if persistent hypotension, cort stim, consider more aggressive intervention.
COUGH: flu + COPD +/- PNA.  5d into flu symptoms, will not treat w/ anti-viral medication.  Will treat for COPD flare, as well as CAP coverage.
	-ceftriaxone/azithromycin x 7 days
	-prednisone taper 40mg  0mg over 12 days. Standing nebs.
CHEST PAIN: small troponin leak, likely demand in setting of hypovolemic hypotension.
	-keep O2 sats 100%, HCT>30 (T&S to be sent)
	-ASA, lopressor, statin, plavix
ARF: baseline Cr 1.5, now >2.  suspect some amount of ATN.
	-did not correct after volume resuscitation
	-urine lytes, spin urine.
NON-AG ACIDOSIS: related to ileostomy?
	-correcting w/ IVF.
	-if not back to baseline after resuscitation, initate work-up.

FOLLOW-UP VISIT: CAD, DM, HTN



HPI:  The pt is a 71 yo female here for follow-up visit for DM monitoring, lipid management, htn.  She was hospitalized for acute MI last December and is being followed by cardiology.  Since her last follow-up the patient has had no episodes of exertional or rest chest pain, no DOE or SOB.  She was visiting her relatives in Oregon this month and did have one episode of SVT in setting of viral URI.  Experienced sudden onset of palpitations with discomfort, lasted 30 minutes without chest pain, lightheadedness or diaphoresis and then resolved spontaneously.  She has had no further episodes.  She has been compliant with her medications over the last few months and has not experienced any side effects; however, when asked directly, has had 2 or 3 episodes of lightheadedness in morning with abrupt position changes, nothing long-lasting and no near syncope.

     Pt reports blood sugars by finger stick at home of 100-140s generally.  Has had good control by her accounts over last few months.  Was unaware of results of May blood draw with increase in HA1C of 8.0.

Labs:  last hemoglobin A1C in 5/77 of 8.0, gluc 192, LDL 115, TG 71, HDL 36



A/P:  71 yo female with DM, HTN, and heart disease with slightly worsening glycemic and lipid control when tested 2 months ago, perhaps related to modest weight gain of 10 lbs.

     1. DM - pt with rising A1C despite good FS at home.  Given pt feels control has improved since last visit, will stall on changing micronase until next visit at one month.  Pt to have repeat a1c at that point, and if still high, will double micronase.  Good bp control on zestril.  Had microalb this year.  Still awaiting visit to ophthal - gave pt another referral.

     2. CAD - pt with LDL of 115 when previously well controlled on this dose of zocor.  After negotiation with patient, have agreed to wait to raise dose until next visit as well.  Would benefit from 30 mg tab.  Otherwise TG look good.  Pt with episode of SVT in setting of viral illness.  BP and pulse will tolerate small increment in b-blocker.  Given known CAD without intervention, impt to control SVTs.  Increase atenolol to 100 mg QD, keep zestril at current dose.

     3. HM - pt refuses mammogram.  She continues to be suspicious that screening tests are experimental and given her age ""wouldn't change anything.""  Discussed baseline bone density test, and she has agreed to consider this.  Refused colonscopy at this point.

Dear Dr. Feldman:

We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
today in the Cardiology clinic.  As you know, she is a
very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  She
last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
Oregon.  Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
been doing quite well.  She states that she has episodes of
palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
minutes.  She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope. 
She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.  Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.  She
states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
Cessation Program.

Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
Protonix, and Allegra.

On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress. 
Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
beats per minute.  Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
edema.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits. 
JVP is 8 cm of water.  Chest is clear to auscultation and
percussion bilaterally.  PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.  Abdomen
is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.  Pulse examination is
normal.

Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.

ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.  There is a nonspecific Q-wave
abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
compared to prior.

In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.  Her palpitations and
likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
quite acceptable for her.  Therefore, she wishes no consideration
of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.  She
has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.  Regarding
her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
diabetes.  However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
LDL.  Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
to 40 mg q.h.s.

I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months. 
Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
cardiovascular issues.  Thank you very much for referring this
very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.  

Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.

Mr. Vieira presented to Dr. Atwood clinic 
today with persistent wound collection in the below knee popliteal incision. He noticed a lump approximately 3 weeks ago, underwent incision and drainage with wick placement and started a course of PO antibiotics. This has continued to drain serosanguinous fluid, apparently the overall induration and erythema with some additional fluid under moderate pressure was released. He has been seen daily by a visiting nurse and she can do the dressing, replacing the wick, and putting a sterile absorbent dressing on top of this. We will see him again in another week.
  He is on coumadin, last dose 3.5 last night. 

Denies fevers chills, SOB, cough.

Re: Nancy Xayarath

ANC Unit #:  111-64-17



Dear Dr. Townsend:



	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot.



	As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity.  She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.  She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot. She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.  Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her. She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in. Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.  



	Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.  She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.  Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.  She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.

	

	Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.  She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.  She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely. She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  The skin is of normal turgor. She has no active plantar ulcers on

Re:  Nancy Xayarath

either foot. At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.  



	No new x-rays were obtained today.



	Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.



	Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.  It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.  I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.  I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.  We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer. She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you kindly for this referral.



Best personal regards,

RE:  Vicente, Kadeem F.
     MRN: 948-59-58-0
 
Dear Miles:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.  This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical
history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status
post total knee replacement.
 
He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic
coronary artery disease.  His history of coronary artery disease
begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement
in June of 2091.  In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness
and sat down.  He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of
consciousness or edema.  Workup at that time included a thallium
test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an
echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.  He began therapy
at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,
Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin.  He had
been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA
until this past spring.  He actually had done very well with risk
factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and
following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his
weight.  In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going
up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest
discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.  He stopped
working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on
nitrate therapy.  Since that time he has noted that he has had
significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has
actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been
taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.  He does note
fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a
night.  He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness.
 
Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,
Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin.  He has no known drug
allergies.
 
On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was
noted to be 220/100.  At the present time it is 180/100 with a

heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.  There is no
increase in jugular venous pressure.  His carotids are free of
bruits.  His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,
and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and
physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdominal
exam is notable for a ventral hernia.  There is no organomegaly and
neither are there bruits present.  Lower extremities are notable
for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses with no edema.  Skin exam is notable only for the senile
angioma.
 
Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which
is new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.  MIBI was
notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no
significant ischemia on 5/6/94.  The ejection fraction on a gated
spect was 57%.  
 
In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new
myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in
March of 2094.  He could, however, also have developed his
progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on
his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.  I will
be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.  In
either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical
regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood
pressure.  I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition
and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would
increase to 60 mg p.o. q.d.  I also would consider further decrease
of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after
assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program. 
Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily
activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route. 
I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the
hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of
risk factor reduction.  
 
I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you. 
It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.
 
Sincerely,

Diagnosis:  

1. Colon cancer

2. Lung Cancer



Reason for Visit: 

routine f/u



Main Symptoms/Side Effect of Treatment:   

 weight loss has stabilized

having more reflux

recently found to have worsening renal function and was seen by Dr Xie and felt to need dialysis in the near future. The cause of the RI is unclear but probably related to either diabetic or hypertensive disease.

  	  	

Past Oncologic History:  

1. T3 N3 adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe diagnosed in 3/59 and s/p chemoradiation followed by resection

2. T2 N1 adenocarcioma of the sigmoid colon s/p adjuvant 5FU/LV completing therapy in 09/61

  

Social History: 

;nothing new to report



Review of Systems:  



All other systems are negative.

  



Physical Exam: deferred



Laboratory Data: CEA and CA19-9 normal



Chest abd pelvic CT without contrast: no evidence of metastatic disease



PET scan:  No definite evidence of metastatic disease



Impression:  

1. Stage 3 colon cancer:

2. Stage 2 lung cancer

3. Anemia

4. Renal Insufficiency



She has no evidence of metastatic disease and her main problem is her impending renal failure. We had a very blunt discussion about dialysis and her desire to not go on it. She understands that she would die from progressive renal dysfunction and she will talk more about this with Drs Yeomans and Xie.



Plan: 

1. as above



Counseling comprised the majority of today's visit which was 15 minutes

ID/CC:	Weakness 



HPI:  Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness.  Mr. Wood was at work this morning and at 9 AM he started to feel weak.  He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength.  He states he really didn't have any symptoms other than weakness, but when asked about chest pain, he notes that he had mild chest discomfort, which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise.  He also describes some mild lightheadedness.  He has 2 pillow orthopnea, but he denies any fever, chills, nausea, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, syncope, HA, dyspnea, chest pain, PND, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms.  He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry, bright red, pencil thin, or watery.  He denies any abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms, while exertion worsened his symptoms.  He has had these symptoms before in March of this year, but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then.  At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing, and he was found to have a Hct of 24.9.  He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy, where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps.  The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy.  He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI.  Of note, his previous colonoscopies had shown tubulovillous adenomas including a 25 mm polyp that could not be fully resected and had been   Before this admission he was seen by his worksite nurse who sent him to his PCP.  Dr. David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia (Hct 25.4 MCV 75), dizziness, and orthostasis.

Impression:  



Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.  His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.  His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.  He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.  Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.  Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.  Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.  He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.  His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.  He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.  Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.  His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.   



Plan: 

1)	GI Bleed

a.	Transfuse pRBCs if necessary - Consent and Type and Cross (O +)

b.	Two large bore IVs if rapid resuscitation is needed

c.	Follow Hct Q8H and watch HR and BP for signs of active bleeding

d.	Nexium 40 POQD

2)	Heme:  Anemia

a.	Send Iron Studies, TSH

b.	FeSO4 325 mg POTID

3)	CV:  

a.	Rule out MI:  Enzymes + Monitor

b.	Hypertensive:  Continue on HCTZ and Zestril

c.	Hyperlipidemia:  Continue Lipitor

ID/CC:	59 y.o. male with SOB during a CT on the day of admission

HPI:  Pt. is a 59 y.o. male with DLBCL dx'ed with stage 4 DLBCL in 11/07, S/P CHOP-R (finished 3/08), HTN, GERD, and anemia who p/w acute onset of SOB while lying down during a f/u staging non-contrast CT on the day of admission. Pt. notes a 5lbs weight gain over the past week. He also reports a 1-2 week h/o increasing DOE when he performs his household chores or working in his backyard. At his baseline, can can walk    of a mile w/o dyspnea or CP. 4 days PTA, he had to    take it easy    during a picnic as he would easily develop DOE with minimal exertion.  2days PTA, pt. experienced coughing bouts when he tried to lie down for sleep. The patient acutely developed SOB after lying down for a few minutes during his CT. He felt 1/10 CP during this episode located in the R middle sub-sternum. The pain lasted for approximately 10 min, dull in quality, did not radiate, did not change with position, relieved after given NTG in the ED. He experienced a similar CP during an administration of his chemo several months PTA. This CP was determined not be be cardiogenic. + diaphoresis, - N/V, - lightheadedness, - palpitations. He reports eating a lot of salty foods. - recent URI/sick contacts.

CXR:	

New mild interstitial pulmonary edema.



EKG:	Nl sinus rhythm, L axis deviation, nl intervals, T wave inversions I, aVL, T wave flattening V3-V6, old inferior infarct.



Echo 11/07 - There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  Theestimated ejection fraction is 73 %.



___________________________________________



Impression: Pt. is a 59 y.o. male with DLBCL dx'ed 11/07 s/p CHOP-R, HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and anemia who p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of a BP = 178/108 likely 2/2 flash pulmonary edema.





Plan: 

CHF - pt.'s PE resolved s/p 20 mg IV lasix, administration of lopressor, and NTG. He showed no signs of volume overload during the physical exam. Chest CT showed no acute hemorrhage, PTX, or lymphangitic spread (preliminary read). Follow-up official CT read. No contrast was given, therefore, acute SOB could not be secondary to contrast allergy. This pt.'s salty diet and uncontrolled HTN most likely led to the acute decompensation. No evidence of infection. Pt. will receive an Echo to evaluate for possible worsening LVEF s/p antrhacycline chemo vs. diastolic dysfunction with LV hypertrophy. F/U BNP. Will re-dose lasix only if necessitated by clinical signs of volume overload.

Angina - This pt. has EKG changes and pain that is possibly cardiogenic in origin. Will obtain serial enzymes to r/o MI. Begin ASA, increase lopressor to 50 TID, captopril instead of lisinopril for easier titration of BPs, 2LO2 via nasal canula. Consider stress test before d/c.

Prophylaxis - fragmin 5000 SC QD. SOB resolved after lasix + lopressor. Unlikely PE in this setting but pt. is hypercoagulable given malignancy. Low threshold for CT PE protocol.

GERD-Omeprazole.

Onc - Will check uric acid and LDH to eval. for possible TLS. Unlikely given normal electrolytes and good renal function. CT shows no lymphangitic spread but must f/u official read in the AM.

The patient returns not having been seen since last September by
me and at which time she had some chest pain which did not turn
out to be anything significant.  She is followed up by Dr. Horne
who felt that she had a lot of anxiety and she was at that time
on lisinopril as well as her other diabetic medications.  She
comes back from Maine.  She is on the following medications:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d.
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d.
3.  Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.
4.  Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.
5.  Avandia 4 mg q.a.m.
6.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.
7.  Tegretol 300 mg in the a.m. 150 mg in the p.m.
8.  Neurontin 200 mg b.i.d. (she was told she could discontinue
this)
9.  Premarin and Provera discontinued.
10.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
12.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d.

She states today that her abdomen has been distended for the past
5 days.  She has not had a bowel movement in 10 days.  She
ordinarily has a bowel movement once every 2 weeks.  She takes
nothing to move her bowels and she is extraordinarily upset about
her daughter who is homeless.  She has provided for her daughter,
helped her get a job, and the daughter is emotionally ill, and I
have advised the patient that she should be in a mental
institution.  The patient no longer care for her daughter and her
daughter cares nothing about her father and mother.  It is a
hopeless situation and 45 minutes were spent in discussion of the
daughter's illness and what the patient would do about this.  I
have told her to use some Dulcolax suppositories and Dulcolax by
mouth for probable impacted feces, although this is not an
uncommon thing for her and I have ordered a set of blood tests to
check on her diabetes, kidney function, etc.  She has a good
physician in Maine where she is planning to move in June and
she will return to me next week for a complete physical.  She
does have diabetic neuropathy mild and diabetic nephropathy mild.
 Her back has healed.  She no longer uses a cane to walk except
on climbing stairs.  She no longer has any chest pain or
shortness of breath.  She is extraordinarily anxious and
hopefully she will listen to the advice that I gave her.  Total
time spent during this visit was 45 minutes.

Labs/Studies:

BUN/Cr 58/2.08 Glu 111 Tn negative W 9.5 plt 262 INR 1.1



A/P: 76 RH F with prior CVA with minimal dysarthria at baseline HTN, HL, here with sx most consistent with idiopathic Bells palsy of the L. face given lower motor neuron distribution of her findings. Other considerations include recrudescence of her prior CVA sx, vs. HTN urgency/emergency.



Plan:

MRI/A of the brain with susceptibility to r/o CVA

BP control goal SBP &lt; 160 mm Hg

If negative for CVA, dx likely idiopathic bells which is a clinical dx. 

If above etiologies CVA, HTn related recrudescence of CVA sx negative, would favor initiating impiric tx for idiopathic bells with steroids and valacyclovir

May continue to follow up with PCP

If sx do not improve after trial of tx for Bells, then call Internal Medicine for appt. 415-726-3969

Diagnosis:  thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis



HPI:

27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.



This 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.  At the time, blood sugar was >500.  Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.  The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.  



At BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.  LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.  He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.   Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.  He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.  Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.



The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.  HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.  He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.



Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.   Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.   Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.  Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.  He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.  But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.  A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.  As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.  Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.  As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.  As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.  For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.



He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.  His energy has been good.  He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.  No bleeding/bruising.  No further swelling in his arms/legs.  He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess/weakness/dizziness.

Assessment and Plan:



Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.  He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.  Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.  It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.



At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.  If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.



At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.  If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.



Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.  



In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.
