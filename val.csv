                                                       Patient Name: ROBISON,NEIL [ MRN: 013423CA ]

                                                         Date of Visit: 04/27/81









Mr. Robison comes to clinic today for f/u after being hospitalized for central pontine CVA in early April.  He has been working with OT, speech therapy and nutrition at home, with some improvement in gait and fine motor skills.  He still feels like his speech is poor and his right hand is not working at baseline.  Other complaints include a HA every morning which is global and tends to improve over the course of the day with tylenol.  He does admit to some visual changes that have been occuring for about one year--transient decreased vision in right eye, lasting for several minutes to hours and happening about twice per week.  He saw an ophthamologist in 12/02 who, per the patient, found no abnormalities.  He also states that he has had nonproductive cough with chest congestion for about 2 weeks. No fevers, chills, n/v or diarrhea.  Some rhinorrhea but no sinus sxs.  He has had difficulty with muscle cramps since his BMT which respond well to gatorade.  The nutritionist is not thrilled with the high salt content of gatorade.  We discussed the possibility of drinking less gatorade and adding a banana daily.

A/P: 53 yo man with h/o lymphoma s/p allo BMT in 10/78 c/b chronic skin GVHD, pseudomonal pna and post herpetic neuralgia who was recently hospitalized with central pontine CVA.  Trans thoracic echo, spiral CT and carotid ultrasound did not reveal embolic source.  MRI showed right MCA cut off with collateral flow.  His sxs of dysarthria and right hand dysfunction seem to be slowly improving with OT, speech therapy. Daily HA are concerning.  

--repeat head CT to rule out progression of infarct or bleed into infarct territory. Pt may need another MRI in future, but is wary of MRI and may require open machine

--pt has neuro follow up at the end of May.  We need to discuss with the neurologist the duration of anti-coagulation

--check coags, CBC, Chem 7 today; adjust coumadin prn

--increase lopressor to 50 BID and continue BP monitoring by VNA

--pt has f/u with his primary oncologist Dr. Savage at RGSC on 5/6. 

--no abx at this time for cough without focal pulm findings and abscence of fever. Follow closely

--have asked pt to make another ophtho appt to eval visual changes in right eye (which apparently have been happening for a year and have not been progressive)

--RTC in 3 weeks to review CT results and lab tests.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old female who returns to the clinic for a followup visit.  The patient has multiple medical problems including severe and extreme hypertension as well as high blood pressure and chronic renal failure for which she is currently attending dialysis sessions 3 times per week.  The patient also is currently being treated for hot flashes with Prempro.  The patient states that she ran out of her blood pressure medications including the patch 2 days ago.  She also complains of frequent popping and loss of hearing in her right ear.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 182/94, weight is 211 pounds, and pulse is 76.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2.  Negative S3, S4, no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, no edema, nontender.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure, on dialysis.  The patient appears to be doing much better and has stabilized on her regular dialysis sessions.  She is still waiting for donor for a renal transplant.  She will follow up with nephrology as scheduled.  She is currently being immunized for her transplant and will receive her third hepatitis B shot as well as her second hepatitis A shot today.

2.  Right ear problem.  The patient has wax buildup in her right ear and I recommended that she use olive oil on a nightly basis to resolve the earwax.

3.  Diabetes mellitus.  Control is much better.  There is a recent hemoglobin A1c of 6.3.

4.  Severe hyperlipidemia, which has improved after the patient was started on dialysis.  Of note, was also a very high HDL.  The patient is currently on no hypolipemic medication.  We will check a fasting lipid profile at this point.

5.  Severe hypertension.  Prescriptions for nifedipine and the clonidine patch were refilled.

6.  Hyperparathyroidism.  We will check a PTH level today.

The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up. She has been having
symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
clear history of her symptoms. At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
fall over to her right side. There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
symptoms. She has not actually had syncope. There is no positional component to her
symptoms. I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms. The
MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
ovale and bilateral pontine region. She had small chronic lacunar infarcts. She reports
that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms. She had some left internal carotid
mild 30% proximal stenosis. Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts. Most likely related to hypertension rather
than embolic disease. Her blood pressure has been very well controlled. In fact, today
on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60. She brought her medications with her and
has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. She had not taken her medications today and
her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in
the left. Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits. Her lungs are clear without
wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
S1, S2. 
       
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension. Now with lower blood
pressure and some lightheadedness. We will d/c her atenolol. I would like her to get a
repeat blood pressure in one week. I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her
diabetes. She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.

NAME:     Wilson, Gabriel

MRN:     8514931



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian

female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness. Her daughter,

who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today. Apparently, for

many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled""

when she walks. This never occurs when lying down or sitting. It is only when she is

walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or

backward. At times, she does visibly veer when she walks. She has had one fall a

number of months ago when she broke her wrist. She has not had any subsequent

falls. There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,

numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache. She actually

feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it

was a little more severe. Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.

Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms. 



Review of other systems notable for general fatigue. Otherwise unremarkable. No

chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,

hyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts. 



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,

Lopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx. 



FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease. 



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece. She neither drinks nor

smokes. 



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,

72-year-old female. BP 140/84. Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,

except for decreased hearing on the left. On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift. Good

power throughout upper and lower extremities. She does, however, seem mildly

bradykinetic diffusely. Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric. Amplitude

is normal for finger tapping. Power in the lower extremities 5/5. Sensory exam with

mild vibratory loss in the toes. Finger-to-nose testing intact. Foot-tapping decreased

bilaterally. Romberg sway. Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to

either side. She is unable to perform tandem. DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+

ankle jerks. Babinski flexor bilaterally. 



DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter

hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral

pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right

internal capsule and bilateral thalami. Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the

anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the

posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment

stenosis of the basilar artery. Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134. 8/30

bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits. LFT's normal except SGOT

elevated at 46. 



IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and

hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady. She is

symptomatic only when she walks. Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the

toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the

wide-based, at times veering gait. It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are

multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.

It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given

that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she

is concerned about.  However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,

she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she

became hypotensive. As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding

Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she

can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine. I will see her in follow up in two

months to see how she is doing. May also consider checking CBC, given her

symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she

walks about one block. The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both

sides of her chest. It is not severe, sharp chest pain. It does not radiate to her back.

There is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain. No PND, orthopnea or edema.

The last time she had the pain was two weeks ago. She has a history of TIAs and our

goal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a

low flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.



She is on aspirin and Plavix.



She had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.

She has not had a recent stress test.  



PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood

pressure is 160/70. Neck supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs clear without wheezes,

rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur

or gallop. Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. No edema.  



Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story

which sounds convincing for exertional angina. She has not had any symptoms in over

two weeks. Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She should stop it if she

feels lightheaded on the medication. She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d. We

will schedule her for a sestamibi ETT. She will follow-up in one week.

Visit Note



Patient Name: WILSON, GABRIEL                        MRN: 8514931

Dictated Date: 06/29/2097                      Dictated By: Julie Fraser, M.D.



Date of Visit: 06/28/2097





 Patient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today. Her daughter Gibbs was translating. She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems. She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past. 



Recently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house. They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication. When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not. Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol. Her daughter also has increased her insulin/70/30 to 48 units in the morning. She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars. She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low. She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat. She has had similar symptoms to that with low sugars in the past however when the daughter checks her sugars they are all in the 174 to 225 range. She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249. The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner. 



The patient reports that she feels dizzy at times. She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating. She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations. Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down. No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness. 



Of note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved. 



Her cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response. No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images. From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length. She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid. Her prior MRI from 07/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct. 



The patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia. Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not. Sometimes her daughter thinks that she is actually just being stubborn or uncooperative rather than having difficulties with her memory though other times it seems as if she she does have some dementia. 



She also has been followed in Glancy Memorial Hospital. 



On exam she is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 124/60. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. No CCE. She has chronic right facial weakness consistent with her known Bell's palsy. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 otherwise intact though vision was not assessed. Motor 5/5. Reflexes 1+, absent ankle jerks, downgoing toes. Gait is slightly wide based which is consistent with the prior note from Dr. Hope Kincaid. Sensation intact to light touch. Distal pulses intact. 



1. Hypertension which is much better controlled on current regimen. Continue same. Check Chem-7. 



Type 2 diabetes. Her daughter attributes some of her lightheadedness to hypoglycemia but the documented sugars are not at all low. Ideally we would correlate her symptoms with a fingerstick sugar. 



Lightheadedness and dizziness. We are going to check a Chem-7 and then repeat an MRI/MRA of her head and neck. 



She should follow up in neurology and also with her counselor. She will follow up with me in a few weeks after the MRI/MRA.

EDVISIT^98044905^WARE, VINCENT^12/21/74^VILLA, SCOTT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with

a history of diabetes and myelodysplastic syndrome, status post

stem cell transplant who presents to the Emergency Department

with a 2 to 3 week history of increasing exertional dyspnea.  The

patient denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope but does

complain of bilateral lower extremity edema times several weeks. 

The patient has been worked up for the symptoms as an outpatient

and placed on Lasix for the past 2 weeks and had an

echocardiogram today, which was remarkable for atrial

fibrillation.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department

for further evaluation.  Please see the written record for

further details.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes,

myelodysplastic syndrome, status post stem cell transplant.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Basal cell resection.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking, alcohol, or illicit

drug use.

MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, vitamin D, Lantus, and acyclovir.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I have examined the patient and agree with

the physical as documented.  Of note, the patient is awake and

alert, in no acute distress.  Vitals:  Temperature is 96.9, pulse

is 100 to 128, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 118/70,

and oxygen saturation is 96%.  Lungs:  Clear bilaterally with no

rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiovascular exam:  Irregularly

irregular rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft

with no tenderness, guarding, or rebound.  Extremity exam:  The

patient has bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema, left

greater than right.  No calf tenderness.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Mr.

Ware is a 67-year-old man with diabetes and a 2-week history of

increasing dyspnea on exertion.  His chest x-ray did not

demonstrate pulmonary edema, but was significant for bilateral

pleural effusions.  The patient's EKG demonstrated a flutter with

a ventricular rate of 121 with inferolateral T-wave inversions. 

The patient was given IV and p.o. Cardizem with control of the

ventricular rate.  At the time of this dictation, the patient's

laboratory data are not available.  The plan is to admit the

patient to the hospital for further management.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  New onset AFib.

DISPOSITION:  Admission.

CONDITION UPON ADMISSION:  Good.

EDVISIT^43294739^FINNEY, INDIANA^12/15/90^MARTIN, CONSTANCE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and

atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of

sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.  She

said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.  She also

said it felt like a burning.  She had mild shortness of breath

and left arm achiness.  She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers

or chills.  She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no

syncope.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,

and atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,

aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,

respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters. 

The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,

talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.  ENT: 

Atraumatic, normal to inspection.  Eyes are normal.  Neck: 

Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.  Respiratory:  Clear

to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and

rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Back is nontender. 

Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema. 

Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Mood and affect is normal. 

Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or

sensory deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about

150, unclear.  It seemed that there was T waves in V3.  There is

no evidence of ST elevation MI.  We thought this could be an SVT.

 It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.  Our

plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement. 

Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal

sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was

clear that there was T waves.  At this point, we decided to give

her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium

3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,

glucose 268.  ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,

total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,

calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.  White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit

42.7, and platelets 438, 000.  INR is 1.  UA is negative for

infection with trace blood present.

PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient

had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.  If both of

those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home

from the ED Observation Unit.  It is unclear the etiology of her

arrhythmia.  It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke

spontaneously.  The patient is to follow up with her primary

doctor.

DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

Assessment/Plan:

1.	 Seizures-likely in setting of subtherapuetic Dilantin dose-will finish one gram load and start PO dilantin in am at 300 tid per neurology recommendations and check levels and await levels 10-15. Head CT negative for new process and no evidence of other reason for seizure. Patient on Keppra in past-needed now? Will ask neurology

2.	Pyuria-uncertian if significant due to the patient's likely minimal urine output-sent for culture-will await results-continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with Vancomycin (1 gram given in ED) and ceftriaxone.

3.	High WBC-Abd CT reportedly negative as was CXR-will check final results and patient without symptoms-blood cultures pending-follow temp curve and WBC and continue abx until cultures negative

4.	Electrolyte abnormalities-patient on hemodialysis-will schedule for am-if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia.

5.	Renal transplant-continue Prednisone

6.	CVA-Will continue Aggrenox for now

7.	Other-continue home meds for now except lactobacillus as certain of purpose?

Dear Dr. Schmidt:

Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today.  As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.  She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.  She has done well since the procedure.  She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.  She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.  She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.  


On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.  She is alert and oriented x3.  She appears grossly neurologically intact.  Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.  Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.  It remains superficial.  She has no other ischemic skin changes noted. 


I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.  She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.  She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.  I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.  She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.  She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen. 


If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,


Hunter Shea, MD

1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.
2.  Nephrocaps 1 daily.
3.  Phoslo 2001 mg t.i.d.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Chest:  Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Skin exam:   There are two small cavities overlying the right scapula  filled with dirt and slight surrounding erythema..  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness or organomegaly.  Extremities:  No edema.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Chronic kidney disease.  On dialysis.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  I prescribed Zocor.
3.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  I am concerned about bone status.  Bone mineral density exam requested.
4.  Skin changes after abscess drainage.  Area was cleaned and covered.
 The patient has history of elevated total protein and amylase.  Will need follow up.

Ms. Louise Iles is a 70 year old female patient of Dr. Xue here today with first visit with me for several issues.
Met with PCP in Feb for multiple issues, DM changed from Actos to Metformin, referral to Internal Medicine; GERD/H-pylori,  (on meds, GI consult) HTN (changed from nitrates to Lisinopril) cholesterol, HA (lab done to r/o TA and PMR) Hepatitis 

She arrived 20 minutes late for her appointment
Today states:
# 1 HA

HA are much better-less in frequency and duration and intensity, Left area occipital/temporal area
ROS denies any visual problems-but does associate them with stressful times


# 2 DM

Test her BG once a week-reports 134, today 156-ate at 1 PM rice

Stopped Actos-now taking Metformin
# 3 HTN
taking meds as prescribed


# 4 GERD: completed antibiotics-feeling better

Last seen by PCP 1 mo ago. At that time, he had been complaining of hypoglycemia w/ sugars in the 70's causing him to feel shakey and anxious. Glyburide was stopped, Metformin dose was adjusted from 1000mg bid to 875mg tid. Today he states he has had no hypoglycemic sxs since these changes. He forgot his logbook today. Reports lowest sugar in the 80's, highest 180. Most fastings around 100, randoms 140-150's. He is still walking every day. States his back is ""fine"", no longer painful, though sometimes stiff upon wakening. Has appt at Promptcare for eye exam later this month.

Has gained #14 in 1 month, which he blames on increased stress at home. His cat was injured and recuperating. His mother was recently dx'd w/ ""carcinoma"", but he is unclear of type. He eats when he is stressed. Has not seen psych yet, but states they have been playing ""phone tag"". He continues to have insomnia and finds neither the Prozac or Serax helpful. Depression is stable, but not any better. Would like to change from Prozac to something else. Plans to call psych today and discuss. Denies SI/HI.

HTN managed w/ Lisinopril 40mg and HCTZ 25mg qd added last time. He is tolerating the med w/ no dizziness, CP, SOB, palps, edema. 

Lipids managed w/ Zocor, increased from 20 to 40mg qd last month. He denies myalgias. Has not made appt to see nutrition yet. He is a non-smoker.

Recent significant labs include urine malb/creat 4314, down from 6381. A1c 8.0, down from 10.6 at time of dx.

Exam: pleasant obese 31yo man NAD, in good spirits today. Improved eye contact, smiling

Bp 144/99 in triage,   144/92 lg cuff rechecked by me  HR 100reg  Wt #319

Random fingerstick 114

Lungs: clear; no rales, ronchi, wheezes

Cor: RRR; (+)tachy at 100 bpm

Extrems: no pedal edema bilat

A/P: 31yo man w/ multiple medical problems. DM control improving over time w/ no recurrence of hypoglycemia since stopping Glyburide and adjusting Metformin to 875mg tid. No changes made today. Pt encouraged to make appt w/ nutrition to assist w/ DM diet and wt loss. Keep upcoming appt at Promptcare for eye exam. HTN uncontrolled w/ addition of HCTZ, on ACEI also for renal protection. Per PCP, add Atenolol 25mg qd. Potential risks, benefits reviewed. For lipids, on increased Zocor x 1 mo. Recheck LFT's today on increased dose, recheck lipids at next PCP appt in 2 mos. Insomnia and depression stable, but not improving on Prozac and Serax. Pt promises to f/u w/ psych today by phone and meet w/ them ASAP for f/u. Sent to lab for LFT's, plus basic panel and repeat urine malb/creat; f/u as needed. PCP notified of today's visit and plan.

ENDOCRINE/DIABETES STAFF CONSULTATION

Patient: VAUGHN, FRANK			MANAMANA MRN: 6767510
Requesting MD: Dr. Quale			Service: SICU

CC/ID: Asked to see this 33 y/o M admitted with Fourier's gangrene, s/p multiple surgical procedures, for DM management

HPI/ROS: Pt is a 33 y/o with DM-2 who was in his USH until about 2 weeks PTA, when he developed buttock pain.  He had some purulent D/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control.  He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1/21/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks.  He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil.  He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain.  He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms.  Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage.  On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED.  On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling.  In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9.  On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum.  His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs.  An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene.  The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.  He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.

In terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075.  At the time he was feeling ""lousy,"" tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376.  Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.  He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.  Most recently treated with Lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of Glipizide 10 bid and Metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled HbA1c (see below).  He has microalbuminuria.  He is unable to give me a full history.

In the SICU he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 U/hr.  He is being fed with Glucerna continuous TF at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on NPH 50 U q12h.

Impression:  33 y/o M with DM-2 requiring insulin, uncontrolled PTA, here recovering from Fournier's gangrene, still in ICU with multiple IV Abx and being fed with TF, requiring high doses of insulin both IV and SQ.

Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.

Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.  Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.  Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.

Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.

Recommend:
1. Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
2. Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
3. Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
4. Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g. Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
5. Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves

Thank you for interesting consult
Dr. Tan will follow

MANAMANA  MEDICAL  CONSULT  NOTE
PATIENT:  Vaughn, Frank R.
MANAMANA MR#:  6767510
PCP:  Henry Jenkins, M.D. (503 155-7742)
PSYCH:  Brittany Prince, M.D.
CONTACT:  Mother, Haley Vaughn (158 857-4114)
SOURCE:   Patient; M.D. Passoff; Previous Medical Records
PRECAUTIONS:   MRSA; VRE
PRIMARY SERVICE:  Psychiatry Service (Internal Medicine)
CONSULT DATE:   6/19/77
TIME:   2:00 PM
CC:  Suicidal ideation
REASON for CONSULT:  Evaluation for history of medical problems


HPI:  Pt is a 33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation.  Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.  However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.  Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.  He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.  Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.  


The pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.  However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.  Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.


The Medical Service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a Psychiatry Service. 


PMH/PSH
1. Depression:  Symptoms since age 12.

ASSESSMENT
33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.  Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.  All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.  Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.  His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.  He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.  His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.  The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.  His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
2. Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.  If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
3. Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
4. No concentrated sweets diet
5. Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
6. Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
7. Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
8. Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
9. Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service


Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

Micro: Blood culture pending

Studies:  CXR:  Lung fields clear, no evidence of pneumonia. 


CT abd/pelvis:There is mild inflammatory fat stranding, heterogeneity, and slightly increased vascularity involving the anterior abdominal wall, extending in to the scrotum without evidence of drainable fluid collection or air pockets. Mild induration and thickening of the overlying skin of the abdominal wall is also noted. Stable postsurgical scar in the right anterior abdominal wall. Surgical sutures in the anterior abdominal wall. There is a superficial soft tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left anterior abdominal wall, slightly larger on the current study measuring approximately 3.3 cm. There are mild degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.


Procedure note: The area of induration on the left side of the patient&#8217;s pannus was prepped with betadine. 5cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was infiltrated into the area. A 2cm incision was made over the area of fluctuance and approximately 8cc of purulent thick fluid was expressed. A culture of the abscess fluid was sent. The wound was probed gently to break up any loculations. The wound was then packed with &#188; inch dry packing tape. A dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. 


Impression/Plan: 33 year old diabetic male with history of Fournier&#8217;s gangrene s/p multiple debridements and diverting colostomy presents with recurrent cellulitis and abscess of the left side of his pannus. The abscess was drained and packed in the ED. The patient will be admitted for IV antibiotics and careful monitoring of his cellulitis.

Social History:  She is taking 1 course at computer school.



Physical Examination: Her blood pressure was 170/90 - this is much higher for her.  She has conjunctival injection, which is her acute red eye of uremia.  Neck is supple.  Carotid upstroke is normal.  Thyroid is not enlarged.  Chest is clear. She is chronically ill appearing.  She has an S4, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Bowel sounds are normal.  She has a graft in her leg.  She as 1+ to 2+ edema. She has been gaining 4 kg in the interdialytic period.



Impression:  Blood pressure is up.  Hold the Midodrine, readjust her dry weight.  She claims it is 45 kg, I think it may be lower.  May need antihypertensives if blood pressure remains elevated. Reinforced the need for calcium/phosphorus management. She will be seeing Dr. Ebert.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

 - ESRD 2/2 MPGN Dx age 9 mos

 - on HD TThSa at Educare-Pullman

 - previously on PD

 - multiple failed vascular accesses, current AVF placed by Dr. Schmitt 05/85

 - ruptured and infected L thigh graft

 - s/p 2 failed LRRTx (2069, 2078), some issues of non-compliance

  -HTN

  -s/p 3-1/2 parathyroidectomy

  -seizure disorder, last seizure 08/80

  -previous suicidal ideation



SOCIAL HISTORY:former Construction Worker, lives with mother



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: blood pressure is 130/70, pulse 90 and regular.

     Fundi not well visualized. periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, neck was supple, 

     carotid upstroke normal chest clear to auscultation and percussion, S4 no S3 gallop or rub,

     Abdomen, soft, nontender. Bowel sounds are normal. Extremity 

     1+ edema. 

     

IMPRESSION: end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, seizure

     disorder thrombosed A-V fistula, volume overload.



HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent revision of her left upper arm A-V fistulae by Dr. Schmitt

On 8/30/86 without complications. Because her arm was swollen her subsequent dialysis was done 

Utilizing a temporary femoral dialysis catheter. She was noted to be persistently anemic with a 

Hematocrit of 23.3% on 9/05/86. It was felt that her low hematocrit was due to both blood loss from

Persistent severe menorrhagia as well as a dilutional component from fluid overload. She was electively 

transfused 2 units of packed cells on 9/05/86 while on dialysis utilizing her revised A-V fistulae. 

The rest of her hospital course was uneventful. She was hyperphosphatemic in hospital and was given dietary counseling for use of her phosphate binders. She was discharged home with recommendations for a GYN

Follow-up to assess her persistent mennorhagia and for f/u with her vascular surgeon Dr. Schmitt. She will continue 3x/week dialysis in her Educare-Pullman outpatient unit.

ID/CC  30 year old with ESRD/HD with facial swelling 

HPI:     This patient presented to the ED with a 1 day h/o facial swelling.  She also reports diffuse abdominal pain x several days; as well as chills at dialysis on Wednesday.  She   s attended all dialysis sessions recently for her full time; she has had two infiltrations that resulted in early removal from the HD machine, but she made up her time on other days.  She feels she has been becoming increasingly volume overloaded for the last 1-2 weeks; she has requested an additional (4th) HD session each week but her OP center has not been able to accommodate her. 

The patient went to Internal Medicine this AM and had a brachicephalic stenosis dilated near the site of a prior stent.  

Past Medical History    adapted from prior notes

      -Had Fistulogram 11/2086
      -Maintained on coumadin 
   -ruptured and infected L thigh graft
   -s/p 2 failed LRRTx (2069, 2078), some issues of non-compliance
   -H/o SVC stenosis s/p stenting procedure

HTN
S/p subtotal parathyroidectomy
Seizure disorder, last seizure 08/80
Anxiety disorder 
H/o suicidal ideation

Medications
Prednisone 2.5 qAM, Nephrovites 1 qd, Protonix 40 qd, Dilantin 200 bid, Tegretol 625 bid, Atenolol 50 qd (non-hd days only), Nifedical 30 qd (non-hd days only), Paxil 10 qd, Doxepin 50 qhs, Plavix 75 qhs, Coumadin 5 qhs, Xanax, Phoslo 4 qac, Fosrenol 2 qac  

Allergies
Demerol - seizure; Penicillins - rash; Quinolones - seizure; Vancomycin And Derivatives - Red Man's Syndrome

Social History
Lives with mother in St. Paul 

Family History

ROS   Pertinent positives in HPI.  Otherwise negative in detail. 
  
Physical Examination
General:    Pleasant young woman, NAD, cushingoid in appearance with moderate facial swelling

Labs
Na 129  K  5   BUN 54  Cr 7.9  
WBC 6.9  HCT 29.9  Plt 378
INR 1.2

CXR:      Patchy opacity at the medial right lung base which may be related
	to atelectasis or pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
	There is a graft like material in the midline that is unchanged in the previous study 
             and may represent an SVC stent.   

ECG: ST @ 92  Axis    78  LAHB 

Impression
Facial swelling, r/o SVC syndrome
  -It is unclear if the stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein explains the facial swelling. 
  -D/w Dr. Asher, intervention nephrology: thrombosis of another vein not seen at fistulogram might explain symptoms 
  -Infection may be contributing to presentation     she had chills at HD and low grade temp in ED
Pulmonary Infiltrate
ESRD/HD
S/p two failed RTx
Anemia 
Seizure d/o 


Recommendations
IV Abx to cover abdomen, lung, possible intravascular infection
  -Vancomycin 750 mg in HD
  -Suggest Aztreonam or alternative in this PCN/Quinolone allergic patient 
CT Angiogram
Blood cultures - will send from HD 
We will check full set of chemistries in HD
She was not therapeutic on her coumadin and appears to need a higher dose 

HD Plan     3-4-2087 
We will confirm outpatient prescription with OP unit 
   -Tentative Rx:  Opti 160 4 hours  2 K 2.5 Ca bath  UF TBD based on weight 
  -Electrolytes:   K mildly elevated, typical for HD patient after weekend, HD will correct. 
  -EDW/Volume:  Moderately volume overloaded in setting of venous stenosis of access/ plus 2 day weekend. 
  -Anemia:  Continue OP EPO in the form of Aranesp. 
  -Ca/PO4/PTH:   We will recheck PTH in HD.  Please continue Phoslo     Fosrenol with meals. 
   -Access:  L AVF
  -Nutrition: Continue Nephrocaps; 2 gm K+ Diet; 1500 cc fluid restriction

HPI: 
32 yo WF w/ h/o 2 prior failed kidney transplants and now w/  a functioning DDKT placed on 6/16/89, a h/o SVC syndrome requiring angioplasty and declotting and HTN presents w/ acute onset of SOB. 
She says she has had LE edema X one month  that started in the RLE and then became bilateral.  She was started on lasix 20 mg po qd.  The swelling has not resolved. She then describes abdominal fullness/bloating yesterday and sudden onset of SOB last night while getting ready to go to bed.  When she woke up earlier today she still felt SOB and came to the ED.  She denies PND or orthopnea.  She denies chest pain.  Her initial vitals were T 98.6, BP 156/86, HR 97, 99% RA.  She says her BP&#8217;s at home were in a decent range (140&#8217;s) but didn&#8217;t measure her BP since the onset of her SOB.

A/P)
SOB: 
Very high pulm pressures with dilated pulmonary arteries especially in comparison to prior echos in the setting of sudden onset SOB and LE edema in a patient who is sedentary and has had thrombotic events in the past makes PE a likely possibility.  Her poorly controlled HTN, LE edema and rales 
make flash pulmonary edema another consideration.  
Despite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans 
and so could be at risk for a COPD exacerbation but she had good air movement w/o wheezes.  Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids, she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.
&#224;Agree w/ lasix 60 mg iv BID (but pt may be preload dependent w/ such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her)
&#224;V/Q scan and LE dopplers
&#224;If no PE and not better w/ lasix then will need to consider chest CT w/ IV contrast to r/o SVC syndrome and parechymal lund problems.
&#224;When pt feeling better I would check full PFTS to evaluate pulm htn and possibility of COPD.  I would also screen her for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency given the emphysematous changes on prior CT.


RENAL TX:  Cr only mildly above baseline.  Hopefully won&#8217;t worsen w/ lasix.
&#224;check prograf trough
&#224;continue prograf, cellcept, prednisone at usual doses
&#224;given LE edema check uprot/ucr ratio


HTN:  Poorly controlled.  It&#8217;s partly worsenend by her anxiety.
&#224;ativan 0.5 mg iv q 8 hrs prn anxiety
&#224;Labetolol 20 mg IV and start labetolol 100 mg po bid (bblocker effect will slow HR and help flash pulm edema from diastolic dyfct, the combined alpha and beta blockade will give it added efficacy given the severity of her HTN, Norvasc may not be ideal given her LE edema).


???DM:  pt on metformin for &#8220;diabetes prevention.&#8221;  Metformin is contraindicated for Cr greater then or equal to 1.4 in a female pt.
&#224;d/c metformin


H/O METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  Pt on chronic bicarb likely to her baseline mild allograft dysfct.  This can be a sodium load that can worsen her pulm edema.
&#224;d/c Na bicarb

Educare-Fargo B Intern Admission Note


Patient: JACKS, Yasseen
MR #: 8841350
Admit Date: 2/09/50
Location: West 208
Attending: Dodge
PCP: Dr. Giovanni Gabriel (KEKELA / Keystone Heights)
Source: Patient, chart, ED pass-off
Code status: Full (presumed)
Contact: Son: Ursula 543-846-9534


CC: hypotension/unresponsiveness, cough


HPI: Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian 83M w/ HTN, dementia, OA and severe central canal stenosis (recent RCH admission 1/23 - 2/03/50 for associated LUE weakness), significant smoking history, RUL nodule (since &#8217;42), and h/o bronchiectasis, who presents from his nursing home w/ reported episode of hypotension and unresponsiveness on 2/08 around lunchtime.  Per notes, the pt was found to be unresponsive briefly after lunch, BP was checked and found to be in the 80&#8217;s systolic, EMS was activated and an IV was placed.  He quickly became responsive without intervention, and BP came up to the 80s/90s.  Per notes, no reported CP, abdominal pain, HA, LH, focal neurological symptoms, SOB, palpitations.  Of note, the pt was recently hospitalized at RCH 1/23 &#8211; 2/03/50 during which time he had labile BP&#8217;s including HTN as well as question of orthostasis, and was discharged on Hydralazine, HCTZ, Lisinopril, and Labetalol, after having taken only Atenolol and Terazosin on admission.  At rehab on 2/05 (3days PTA), his meds were changed to Atenolol, Terazosin, HCTZ, and Lisinopril.


In the ED, the pt&#8217;s vitals were T 96.4, HR 63, BP 98/53, RR 20, 95% on RA.  Labs sig for Na 129 (up to 131 after NS), Cr 1.58 (baseline 1.0 to 1.1 but recently 1.4 to 1.6), WBC 9.2 up to 15.6 (83% PMN) during time in the ED, Hct from 38.3 to 32.6 (MCV 85) in ED after fluids (guaiac negative), Head CT negative, CXR w/ slightly more prominent bibasilar L &gt; R opacities.  He also c/o cough while in the ED, w/ no other symptoms, w/ report of some rhonchorous breath sounds.  Two sets of blood cultures were drawn, he was given IVF (NS) at 120cc/hr, and he started on Vancomycin and Cefepime for presumed PNA.


On the floor, the pt complains of cough, mildly productive, but no fevers/chills, SOB, DOE, CP, hemoptysis, or any other sx, but is somewhat of a poor historian.  Of note, pt had recent chest CT (I+) on 1/27/50 to evaluate known RUL nodule, which showed likely aspiration PNA w/ multifocal dependent consolidation.  Pt initially was given 2days of Levofloxacin, but per Discharge Summary pt was not clinically behaving as if he had PNA, so Abx were stopped.


PMH / PSH:
-HTN (recent med adjustments as above)
-Osteoarthritis w/ severe central canal stenosis, recent admission 1/50 w/ LUE weakness/ataxia, followed by NSG/Neuro, currently working w/ PT, in neck collar currently
-RUL nodule first seen 2142, recent CT I+ on 1/27/50 showed 
-Left Thyroid nodule (1.7cm) noted on CT, unclear h/o any workup
-BPH

     IMPRESSION:
     No acute infarct, acute parenchymal abnormality, extra-axial fluid
     collection, midline shift, mass effect, or hemorrhage is seen.
     
     Nonspecific white matter foci, likely representing chronic small
     vessel ischemic changes, and mild generalized volume loss.

___________________________________________________________________________


Impression/Plan:


83M w/ HTN, dementia, OA and central canal stenosis, smoking history, stable RUL nodule, h/o bronchiectasis, recent imaging suggestive of aspiration PNA, and recent BP med changes, who presents w/ hypotension and brief unresponsiveness at rehab per note.  Here w/ WBC elevation, cough mildly productive, no fevers/chills/myalgias or concern for influenza, but concern for PNA, especially aspiration PNA given prior CT findings, CXR w/ increased L opacity.  Will need to exonerate urine and blood as well; no meningismus on exam.  In terms of the hypotensive episode, likely in setting of mild hypovolemia plus several new BP meds from recent discharge, plus further titration at rehab in preceding few days.  Mildly dry on exam, w/ likely hypovolemic hypoNa but will follow. Hct drop since arrival, will re-check, possibly dilutional, guaiac negative.


** Infection / PNA
--obtain sputum sample
--Vanco and Cefepime given cough and WBC elev, presumed HAP (possibly aspiration)
--obtain U/A since none obtained in ED
--f/u blood ctx x 2


** Hypotension on arrival
--infectious workup / treatment as above
--will only give Labetalol and Hydralazine for now (holding ACEi, HCTZ given mild renal failure above prior baseline), add back Terazosin as necessary
--gentle IVF overnight, re-check a.m. lytes (likely mild hypovolemic hyponatremia) and orthostatics after volume challenge


** Anemia
--guaiac negative in ED, will guaiac all stools, type and cross
--f/u rpt Hct, consider iron studies, retic, etc.


** Renal failure
--at same Cr as last week&#8217;s admission, but up from his baseline; BUN/Cr ratio appears c/w pre-renal picture, will check urine lytes, assess response to IVF


** FEN
--Regular no salt added diet w/ Aspiration precautions; gentle IVF as above
--S+S consult


** Ppx / Other
--heparin sc, PPI, bowel regimen
--Full code for now, re-assess w/ son tomorrow

VIGIL, ANTHONY

Amir Naranjo, M.D.
Saint Josephs Hospital Of Atlanta
4 Kelly Street
Bangkok, NJ  53591


Dear Dr. Naranjo:


We saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/09/2087.  He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/30/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation.  In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well.  His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous.  Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30/19 with a mean of 25.  The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5.  He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol.  The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again.  He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6.  He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia.  He has had no dermatologic evaluation.  He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.


Physical Examination:  Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121/71, pulse of 100.  Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung.  Point of maximum impulse is not displaced.  First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear.  He has an S4 at the left sternal border.  The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no peripheral edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished.


The electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute.  There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.


Current Medications:  Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.


Impression:  The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours.  This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy.  We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him.  We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.

Present Illness:  

Asked to see this 66 year old man who was transferred to LEPROSARIUM for care of an ischemic R foot. He has had a series of illness over the spring, beginning with a hospitalization for pneumonia in June. He later developed what was thought to be a splenic subcapsular hematoma (on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation) and then subsequently developed LUQ pain and was found to have a splenic abscess that was drained. In the course of this illness, he also developed an ischemic R foot and was found (at what stage?) to have a popliteal aneurysm. 



At the time of his admission, he was found to have diabetes. He has been treated with Lantus insulin, most recently 15 Units at bedtime, on which regimen he has had consistent overnight drops, often to hypoglycemic levels. He reports that he weighed about 200 pounds before this illness but has lost about 50 pounds.
